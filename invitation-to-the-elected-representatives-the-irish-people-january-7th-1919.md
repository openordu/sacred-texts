A chara,


At a meeting held in the Mansion House on the 7th inst. of the Republican representatives of Ireland, elected at the General Election of 1918, the following resolutions were adopted:
1. ‘That we, the Republican members of the Irish constituencies, in accordance with the National Will, are empowered to call together the Dáil Éireann, and proceed to act accordingly.’

In accordance with the following resolutions, I have the honour of inviting you to attend the opening of An Dáil Eireann, which will be held in Dublin at an early date.


I shall be glad to have a reply from you at your earliest convenience.


Mise
