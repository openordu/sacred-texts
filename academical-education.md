Academical Education
--------------------


[1](javascript:footNote('E800002-021/note001.html'))THE rough outlines

 of a plan of Academical Education for Ireland are now

 before the country. The plan, as appears from **Sir

 James Graham**'s very conciliatory speech, is to be found three Colleges; to give them

 £100,000 for buildings, and £6,000 a year for

 expenses; to open them to all creeds; the education to be

 purely secular; the students not to live within the

 Colleges; and the professors to be named and removed, now

 and hereafter, by Government.


The announcement of this plan was received in the Commons

 with extravagant praise by the Irish Whig and Repeal

 members, nor was any hostility displayed except by the

 blockhead and bigot, **Sir Robert Inglis**—a

 preposterous fanatic, who demands the repeal of the

 Emancipation Act, and was never yet missed from the holy

 orgies of Exeter Hall. Out of doors it has had a darker

 reception; but now that the first storm of joy and anger

 is over, it is time for the people of Ireland to think of

 this measure.


It is for them to consider it—it is for them to

 decide on it—it is for them to profit by it. For

 centuries the Irish were paupers and serfs, because they

 were ignorant and divided. The Protestant hated the

 Catholic, and oppressed him—the Catholic hated the

 Protestant, and would not trust him. England fed the

 bigotry of both, and flourished on the ignorance of both.

 The ignorance was a barrier between our sects—left

 our merchant's till, our farmer's purse, and our state

 treasury empty—stupefied our councils in peace, and

 slackened our arm in war. Whatsoever plan will strengthen

 the soul 


---

p.295


 of Ireland with knowledge, and knit

 the sects of Ireland in liberal and trusting friendship,

 will be better for us than if corn and wine were scattered

 from every cloud.


While 400,000 of the poor find instruction in the

 National Schools, the means of education for the middle

 and upper classes are as bad now as they were ten or fifty

 years ago. A farmer or a shopkeeper in Ireland cannot, by

 any sacrifice, win for his son such an education as would

 be proffered to him in Germany. How can he afford to pay

 the expense of his son's living in the capital, in

 addition to Collegiate fees; and, if he could, why should

 he send his son where, unless he be an Episcopalian

 Protestant, those Collegiate offices which, though they

 could be held but by a few score, would influence

 hundreds, are denied him. Even to the gentry the distance

 and expense are oppressive; and to the Catholics and

 Presbyterians of them the monopoly is intolerable.


To bring Academical Education within the reach and means

 of the middle classes, to free it from the disease of

 ascendency, and to make it a means of union as well as of

 instruction, should be the objects of him who legislates

 on this subject; and we implore the gentry and middle

 classes, whom it concerns, to examine this plan calmly and

 closely, and to act on their convictions like firm and

 sensible men. If such a measure cannot be discussed in a

 reasonable and decent way, our progress to self-government

 is a progress to giddy convulsions and shameful ruin.


Let us look into the details of the plan.


It grants £100,000 and £18,000 a year for the

 foundation of three Provincial Colleges. The Colleges

 proposed are for the present numerous enough. It will be

 hard to get competent Professors for even these.

 Elementary Education has made great way; but the very

 ignorance for which these Institutions are meant as a

 remedy makes 


---

p.296


 the class of Irishmen fit to

 fill Professors' chairs small indeed; and, small as it is,

 it yearly loses its best men by emigration to London,

 where they find rewards, fame, and excitement. The

 dismissal, hereafter, of incompetent men would be a

 painful, but—if pedants, dunces, and cheats were

 crammed into the chairs—an unavoidable task. A

 gradual increase of such Colleges will better suit the

 progress of Irish intelligence than a sudden and final

 endowment. But though the Colleges are enough, and the

 annual allowance sufficient, the building fund is

 inadequate—at least double the sum would be needed;

 but this brings us to another part of the plan—the

 residence of the students outside the College.


To the extern residence we are decidedly opposed. It

 works well in Germany, where the whole grown population

 are educated; but in Ireland, where the adult population

 are unhappily otherwise, 'tis a matter of consequence to

 keep the students together, to foster an academic spirit

 and character, and to preserve them from the stupefying

 influences of common society. However, this point is but

 secondary, so we pass from it, and come to the two great

 principles of the Bill.


They are—Mixed Education and Government Nomination;

 and we are as resolute for the first as we are against the

 second.


The objections to separate Education are immense; the

 reasons for it are reasons for separate life, for mutual

 animosity, for penal laws, for religious wars. 'Tis said

 that communication between students of different creeds

 will taint their faith and endanger their souls. They who

 say so should prohibit the students from associating

 *out* of the Colleges even more than

 *in* them. In the Colleges they will be joined

 in studying mathematics, natural philosophy, engineering,

 chemistry, the principles of reasoning, the constitution

 of man. Surely union in these 


---

p.297


 studies would

 less peril their faith than free communication out of

 doors. Come, come, let those who insist on unqualified

 separate Education follow out their principles—let

 them prohibit Catholic and Protestant boys from playing,

 or talking, or walking together—let them mark out

 every frank or indiscreet man for a similar

 prohibition—let them establish a theological

 police—let them rail off each sect (as the Jews used

 to be cooped) into a separate quarter; or rather, to save

 preliminaries, let each of them proclaim war in the name

 of his creed on the men of all other creeds, and fight

 till death, triumph, or disgust shall leave him leisure to

 revise his principles.


These are the logical consequences of the doctrine of

 Separate Education, but we acquit the friends of it of

 that or any other such ferocious purpose. Their intentions

 are pious and sincere—their argument is dangerous,

 for they might find followers with less virtue and more

 dogged consistency.


We say ‘an *unqualified* separate Education,’

 because it is said, with some plausibility, that the

 manner in which theology mixes up with history and moral

 philosophy renders common instruction in them almost

 impossible. The reasoning is pushed too far. Yet the

 objection should be well weighed; though we warn those who

 push it very far not to fall into the extravagance of a

 valued friend of ours, who protested against one person

 attempting to teach medicine to Catholics and Protestants,

 as one creed acknowledged miraculous cures and demoniacal

 possessions, and the other rejected both!


It should be noted, too, that this demand for separate

 *Professors* does not involve separate

 Colleges, does not assume that any evil would result from

 the friendship of the students, and does not lead to the

 desperate, though unforeseen, conclusions which follow

 from the other notion.


'Tis also a different thing to propose the establishment

 


---

p.298


 of Deans in each College to inspect the

 religious discipline and moral conduct of the

 students—a Catholic Dean, appointed by the Catholic

 Church, watching over the Catholic students; and so of the

 Episcopalians and Presbyterians. Such Deans, and Halls for

 religious teaching, will be absolutely necessary, should a

 residence in the Colleges be required; but should a system

 or residence in registered lodgings and boarding-houses be

 preferred, similar duties to the Deans might be performed

 by persons nominated by the Catholic, Protestant, and

 Presbyterian Churches respectively, without the direct

 interposition of the College; for each parent would take

 care to put his child under the control of his own Church.

 An adequate provision in some sufficient manner for

 religious discipline is essential, and to be dispensed

 with on no pretence.


These, however, are details of great consequence to be

 discussed in the Commons' Committee; but we repeat our

 claim for mixed education, because it has worked well

 among the students of Trinity College, and would work

 better were its offices free, because it is the principle

 approved by Ireland when she demanded the opening those

 offices, and when she accepted the National

 Schools—because it is the principle of the Cork, the

 Limerick, and the Derry meetings; but above all, because

 it is consistent with piety, and favourable to that union

 of Irishmen of different sects, for want of which Ireland

 is in rags and chains.


Against the nomination of Professors by Government we

 protest altogether. We speak alike of Whig or Tory. The

 nomination would be *looked on* as a political

 bribe, the removal as a political punishment. Nay, the

 nomination *would* be political. Under

 great public excitement a just nomination might be made,

 but in quiet times it would be given to the best

 mathematician or naturalist who attended


---

p.299


 the

 levee and wrote against the opposition. And it would be an

 enormous power; for it would not merely control the

 immediate candidates, but hundreds, who thought they might

 some ten years after be solicitors for professorships,

 would shrink from committing themselves to uncourtly

 politics, or qualify by Ministerial partisanship, not

 philosophical study, for that distant day. A better engine

 for corrupting that great literary class which is the best

 hope of Ireland could not be devised; and if it be

 retained in the Bill, that Bill must be resisted and

 defeated, whether in or out of Parliament. We warn the

 Minister!


We have omitted a strange objection to the

 Bill—that it does not give mixed education. It is

 said the Colleges of Cork and Galway would be attended

 only by Catholics, and that of Belfast by Protestants.

 Both are errors. The middle class of Protestants in Cork

 is numerous—they and the poorer gentry would send

 their sons to the Cork College to save expense. The

 Catholics would assuredly do the same in Belfast; they do

 so with the Institution In the Academy there already; and

 though the Catholics in Cork, and the Protestants in

 Belfast, would be the majorities, enough of the opposite

 creed would be in each to produce all the wholesome

 restraint, and much of the wholesome toleration and

 goodwill, of the mixed system of Trinity. Were the

 objection good, however, it ought to content the advocates

 of separate education.


It has been said, too, that the Bill recognises a

 religious ascendency in the case of Belfast. This seems to

 us a total misconception of the words of the Minister. He

 suggested that the Southern College should be in Cork, the

 Western in Limerick or Galway, the Northern in Derry or

 Belfast. Had he stopped at Derry the mistake could never

 have occurred; but he went on to say that if the College

 were planted in Belfast, the building now used for the

 Belfast Academy would serve for the new College, 


---

p.300


 and unless the echoes of the old theological

 professors be more permanent than common, we cannot

 understand the sectarianism of the *building*

 in Belfast.


A more valid objection would be that the measure was not

 more complete; and the University system will certainly be

 crippled and impotent unless residence for a year at least

 in it be essential to a University degree.


The main defect of the Bill is its omitting to deal with

 Trinity College. It is said that the property is and was

 Protestant; but the Bill of '93, which admitted Catholics

 to be educated on this Protestant foundation, broke down

 the title; and, at all events, the property is as public

 as the Corporation, and is liable to all the demands of

 public convenience. But it is added that the property of

 Trinity College is not more than £30,000 or

 £40,000 a year, and that the grant for Catholic

 Clerical Education alone is £20,000 a year; and

 certainly till the Protestant Church be equalised to the

 wants of the Protestant population there will be something

 in the argument. When that Reformation comes, a third of

 the funds should be given for Protestant Clerical

 Education, and the College livings transferred to the

 Clerical College, and the remaining two-thirds preserved

 to Trinity College as a secular University.


Waiting that settlement, we see nothing better than the

 proposal so admirably urged by the Morning Chronicle, of the

 grant of £6,000—we say £10,000—a

 year, for the foundation of Catholic fellowships and

 scholarships in Trinity College. Some such change must be

 made, for it would be the grossest injustice to give

 Catholics a share, or the whole, of one or two new,

 untried, characterless Provincial Academies, and exclude

 them from the offices of the ancient, celebrated, and

 national University. If there is to be a religious

 equality, Trinity College must be opened, or augmented by

 Catholic endowment. For this no demand can be too loud and

 vehement, for the refusal 


---

p.301


 will be an affront

 and a grievance to the Catholics of Ireland.


We have only run over the merits and faults of this plan.

 Next to a Tenure or a Militia Bill, it is the most

 important possible. Questions must arise on every section

 of it; and, however these questions be decided, we trust

 in God they will be decided without acrimony or

 recrimination, and that so divine a subject as Education

 will not lead to disunions which would prostrate our

 country.
