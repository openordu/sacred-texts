p.63


1. What's riches to him
  
That has made a great peacock
  
With the pride of his eye?
  
The wind-beaten, stone-grey,
  
And desolate Three-rock
  
Would nourish his whim.
  
Live he or die
  
Amid wet rocks and heather,
  
His ghost will be gay
  
Adding feather to feather
  
For the pride of his eye.
