p.66


1. Dance there upon the shore;
  
What need have you to care
  
For wind or water's roar?
  
And tumble out your hair
  
That the salt drops have wet;
  
Being young you have not known
  
The fool's triumph, nor yet
  
Love lost as soon as won,
  
Nor the best labourer dead
  
And all the sheaves to bind.
  
What need have you to dread
  
The monstrous crying of wind?
2. Has no one said those daring
  
Kind eyes should be more learn'd?

p.67

5. Or warned you how despairing
  
The moths are when they are burned,
  
I could have warned you, but you are young,
  
So we speak a different tongue.
6. O you will take whatever's offered
  
And dream that all the world's a friend,
  
Suffer as your mother suffered,
  
Be as broken in the end.
  
But I am old and you are young,
  
And I speak a barbarous tongue.
