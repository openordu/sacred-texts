### Encoding


#### Project Description


CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts


#### Sampling Declaration


All editorial introduction, translation, notes and indexes have been omitted. Editorial corrigenda are integrated into the electronic edition. All variants recorded by the editor have been retained and these are tagged as variants. In the case of variant readings, editorial expansions of MS abbreviations, rendered in italic in the edition, are not marked. Missing text supplied by the editor is tagged. The manuscripts have not been freshly collated.


#### Editorial Declaration


##### Correction


Text has been thoroughly checked and proofread. All corrections and supplied text are tagged.


##### Normalization


The electronic text represents the edited text without change.


##### Quotation


Quotation marks are not rendered.


##### Hyphenation


Hyphenation which here also represents the segmentation of Irish compound words is that of the original edition.


##### Segmentation


div0=the saga. Paragraphs and page-breaks are marked. Variant readings from seven manuscripts are encoded within app tags.


##### Interpretation


Names of persons (given names), groups, and places are tagged. Such names are tagged in the variants only when they differ from, or are in addition to, those appearing in the lemma. Where multi-element names cross a lemma boundary, the whole name is given in the reg attribute of the first element, and subsequent separate elements are marked as names.


#### Canonical References


The *n* attribute of each text in this corpus carries a unique identifying number for the whole text.


The title of the text is held as the first *head* element within each text.


*div0* is reserved for the text (whether in one volume or many).


### Profile Description


Created: By unknown author(s) in Irish monastic scriptoria.

 Date range: c.700-800.#### Use of language
