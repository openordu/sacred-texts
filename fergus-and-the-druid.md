### Fergus and the Druid: Author: William Butler Yeats




---

p.32


**Fergus**1. This whole day have I followed in the rocks,
  
And you have changed and flowed from shape to shape,
  
First as a raven on whose ancient wings
  
Scarcely a feather lingered, then you seemed
  
A weasel moving on from stone to stone,
  
And now at last you wear a human shape,
  
A thin grey man half lost in gathering night.

**Druid**
  
What would you, king of the proud Red Branch kings?**Fergus**
  
This would I say, most wise of living souls:
  
Young subtle Conchubar sat close by me
  
When I gave judgment, and his words were wise,
  
And what to me was burden without end,
  
To him seemed easy, so I laid the crown
  
Upon his head to cast away my sorrow.**Druid**
  
What would you, king of the proud Red Branch kings?**Fergus**
  
A king and proud! and that is my despair.
  
I feast amid my people on the hill,
  
And pace the woods, and drive my chariot-wheels
  
In the white border of the murmuring sea;
  
And still I feel the crown upon my head.**Druid**
  
What would you, Fergus?**Fergus**
  
Be no more a king
  
But learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours.**Druid**
  
Look on my thin grey hair and hollow cheeks
  
And on these hands that may not lift the sword,
  
This body trembling like a wind-blown reed.
  
No woman's loved me, no man sought my help.

p.33


**Fergus**
  
A king is but a foolish labourer
  
Who wastes his blood to be another's dream.**Druid**
  
Take, if you must, this little bag of dreams;
  
Unloose the cord, and they will wrap you round.**Fergus**
  
I See my life go drifting like a river
  
From change to change; I have been many things —
  
A green drop in the surge, a gleam of light
  
Upon a sword, a fir-tree on a hill,
  
An old slave grinding at a heavy quern,
  
A king sitting upon a chair of gold —
  
And all these things were wonderful and great;
  
But now I have grown nothing, knowing all.
  
Ah! Druid, Druid, how great webs of sorrow
  
Lay hidden in the small slate-coloured thing!
