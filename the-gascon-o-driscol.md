### The Gascon O'Driscol: Author: Samuel Ferguson




---

p.32


1. In old O'Driscol's pedigree,
  
'Mong lords of ports and galleys,
  
"The Gascon" whence? and who was he
  
First bore the surname? tell us.
  
Not difficult the task
  
To answer what you ask.
2. The merchants from the Biscay sea
  
To ports of Munster sailing,
  
With wines of Spain and Gascony
  
Supplied carouse unfailing
  
To guests of open door,
  
Of old, at Baltimore.


---

p.33

5. Till when against one festal day
  
O'Driscol stock'd his cellars,
  
He found not but of gold to pay
  
In part, the greedy dealers:
  
And, for the surplusage
  
Gave this good son in pledge.
6. They bore the boy to fair Bayonne,
  
Where vines on hills were growing;
  
And, when the days of grace were gone,
  
And still the debt was owing,
  
The careful merchant's heart
  
Grew hard with angry smart.


---

p.3

9. "The wine I sold the Irish knave
  
Is spent in waste and surfeit;
  
The pledge for payment that he gave
  
Remains, a sorry forfeit:
  
Bring forth the hostage boy
  
And set him on employ."
10. "Now youth, lay by the lettered page,
  
Leave Spanish pipe and tabor
  
To happier co-mates of thy age,
  
And put thy hands to labour.
  
Ten ridged rows of the vine
  
To dress and till, be thine."
11. From solar-chamber came the lad;
  
In sooth, a comely creature
  
As e'er made eye of mother glad
  
In well-shaped limb and feature.


---

p.34


As 'mid the vines he stepp'd,
  
His cheek burned, and he wept.
12. "The grief that wrings this pungent tear
  
Springs not from pride or anger;
  
Let the hoe be my hunting-spear,
  
The pruning-knife my hanger:
  
The work ye will I'll do,
  
But, deem my kinsmen true.
13. "Be sure, in some unknown resort
  
Their messengers have tarried;
  
Some head-wind held their ship in port,
  
Some tribute-ship miscarried;
  
Else never would they leave
  
Their pledge without reprieve.
14. "I've seen when, round the banquet board
  
From stintless-circling beaker
  
To all the Name our butlers pour'd
  
The ruby-royal liquor,
  
And every face was bright
  
With mirth and life's delight.
15. "And, as the warming wine exhaled
  
The shows of outward fashion,
  
Their very hearts I've seen unveil'd
  
In gay and frank elation;
  
And not a breast but grew
  
More trusty, more seen through.
16. "These vineyards grew the grape that gave
  
My soul that fond assurance;


---

p.35


And if for them I play the slave,
  
I grudge not the endurance,
  
Nor stronger mandate want
  
To tend the truthful plant."
17. The seniors of the sunny land
  
Beheld him daily toiling—
  
(Old times they were of instincts bland
  
The pagan heart assoiling)—
  
And this their frequent speech
  
And counsel, each with each: —
18. "A patient boy, with gentle grace
  
He bears his yoke of trouble;
  
Serenely grave the ample face,
  
The gesture large and noble,
  
Erect, or stooping low,
  
Along the staky row.
19. "Where'er he moves, the serving train,
  
Accord him their obeisance;
  
The very vintagers refrain
  
Their rude jests in his presence;
  
And—what is strange indeed—
  
His vines their vines exceed.
20. "The tendrils twine, the leaves expand,
  
The purpling bunches cluster
  
To pulpier growth beneath his hand,
  
As though 'twere formed to foster,
  
By act of mere caress,
  
Life, wealth, and joyousness.

p.36

23. "It seems as if a darkling sense
  
In root and stem were native;
  
As if an answering effluence
  
And virtue vegetative
  
(Anointed kings own such)
  
Went outward from his touch.
24. "Behold his nation's sages say
  
A righteous king's intendance
  
Is seen in fishy-teeming bay
  
And corn-fields' stock' d abundance,
  
In udder-weighted cows
  
And nut-bent hazel boughs.
25. "These Scots, apart in ocean set
  
Since first from Shinar turning,
  
Preserve the simple wisdom yet
  
Of mankind's early morning,
  
While God with Adam's race
  
Still communed, face to face.
26. "Not in the written word alone 
  
He woos and warns the creature;
  
His will is still in wonders shown 
  
Though manifesting Nature;
  
And Nature here makes plain
  
This youth was born to reign.
27. "Ill were it, for a merchant's gains,
  
To leave, at toil appointed
  
For horny-handed village swains.
  
God's designate anointed: 


---

p.37


But good for him and us 
  
The act magnanimous.
28. "Blest are the friends of lawful kings
  
To righteous rule consenting:
  
Secure the blessing that he brings 
  
By clemency preventing;
  
And, granting full release, 
  
Return him home in peace.
29. "And, ere your topsails take the wind,
  
Stow ye within his vessel 
  
A pipe the ripest search may find
  
In cellars of the Castle; 
  
Of perfume finer yet
  
Than rose and violet.
30. "That, when, at home, his kin shall pour
  
The welcoming libation,
  
Such rapture-pitch their souls shall soar
  
Of sweet exhilaration,
  
As Bacchus on his pard
  
With moist eye might regard."
31. They stowed the ship; he stepped on board 
  
In seemly wise attended;
  
But this was still his parting word
  
When farewells all were ended:
  
"Be sure my father yet 
  
Will satisfy the debt."
32. And, even as from the harbour mouth 
  
They northward went careering,

p.38


There passed to windward, steering south,
  
O'Driscol's galley bearing,
  
From Baltimore, the gold
  
Of ransom safe in hold.
