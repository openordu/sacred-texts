For the Right Honourable **Wil*liam* Lenthal Esq; Speaker unto the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England**, These present.
  

Mr. Speaker,


Our last from **Corke** gave you an account of the then present condition of your affaires, since then the **Lord of Muskerry** after the treaty concluded at **Rosse**, hath been industrious to make the submission of his party as considerable as he could, so as in several places there have of his party 3000 foot and 700 horse men mounted, and 300 unmounted, brought in their horse and armes, and the **Lord Muskerry** himself doth (as he saith) intend presently to go for **Spaine**, and carry with him 1000 men, and himselfe to return again, if he can obtain any

considerable command, upon the carrying over of the residue of his party, for whom he is there to make his conditions. There is now in tho fastnesses of **Kerry** one **Murtogh O Brian** who is in the head of such of the Irish Rebels as have not submitted, and come in with the **Lord Muskerry**: and **Sir Hardreds Waller** with a considerable party is left in **Kerry** to clear that county, and to make such garisous therein, as may enable the party there to prevent the gathering together of the enemy, or others that may come to them.


The **Earle of Clanrickard** and the body of the rebels that were in a conjunction with him, being beaten from their garisons and castle by a considerable party under **Sir Charles Coot**, and **Commis. Gen. Reynolds** on the one side, and **Col. Venables** with some part of the **Leinster** forces, sent from **Col. Hewson** on the other side, and by planting of garisons at **Belturbet**, in **Cavan**, and securing several passes, have been so attended on all hands, that they could not continue any longer

together in a body, and the **Earle of Clanrickard**, for himselfe, and the several officers of the **Connaught** forces for themselves, and the party under their command, have also come in and submitted; and on the last of this instant are to bring in their horse and armes; and have desired leave to transport 5000, so as all Connaught (if they performed their conditions) will be clear of any enemy that we can heare of: and those rebels that are left in **Ulster**, are attended by **Com. Gen. Reynolds** 

in Longford, and by **Col. Venables** in **Cavan**, and those parts, so as it is hoped they will be reduced to such a condition, as they shal be disinabled at least to infect your quarters, some part or other of our forces continually falling upon them, as they doe move out of their fastnesses. Since the rendition of **Rosse** in **Kerry**, a considerable part of your forces under the conduct of **Lieut. Gen. Ludlow** had some resolutions to march into the north, to make that body of your forces there more considerable; but upon the submission of the **Connaught** enemy, and that there is sufficient force there, to attend the remainder of the **Ulster** rebells at present, it is now held most advisable that the Lieut. General doe forthwith march into **Wicklow** and **Wexford**, and to beat those woods and mountaines, and to find out the enemy, and to plant some garisons in those fastnesses, and then to move further, as shal be most conducing to your service.


There hath been a meeting of very many of the officers at **Clonmell**, of which they gave us notice at **Corke**, and desired our comming thither to them, and we were present with them in all their debates and consultations; the result whereof was put in writing, and sent by **Col. Hewson**, and **Adjutant Gen. Allen**, and we did observe in every one there met, a general desire to testifie their duty, and thankfulnesse for the great care of the Parliament in the plentiful provisions made for them hitherto, and that nothing should be by them presented that might any way seem to be contrary to any resolutions of the Parliament concerning them, but in all things are most willing to be ordered by you, as God shal please to guide and lead you.


We are this day to march to **Kilkenny**, and thence to **Dublin** from whence we hope to give you further account as occasion shal be offered, and at present shal only subscribe our selves,


Your most humble servants


**Jo Jones**.
  

**Miles Corbet**
**Waterford**, the 22th of July, 1652.
