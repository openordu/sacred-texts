**Irish Republican Army** General Headquarters 
**Dublin** 
22nd June, 1921### Reprisals


Brigade Commandants are authorised to answer reprisals against property on the part of the Enemy in the following way: (Where a Division has been formed Brigade Commandants will require to receive formal delegation of authority from their Divisional Commandants.)


On every occasion on which the Enemy destroys house property, or house contents, whether alleging military necessity or not, the following counter-reprisals may be taken:

1. A. A similar number of houses belonging to the most active enemies of Ireland may be destroyed in the Battalion area in which the original destruction takes place.
2. B. An equal number of houses belonging to the most active enemies of Ireland, may, in addition, be destroyed at that point in the Brigade area concerned which may be considered as the centre most strongly occupied by such enemies.
3. C. The case should be reported to G.H.Q. with a covering statement of what has been done; and with a view to possible further action.
4. D. Where the Enemy persists in taking counter-reprisals, they may be answered in the same way; stopping only when the district concerned has been entirely cleared of active enemies of Ireland.



Formal notice shall be served on any person whose house is so destroyed, stating clearly that it is a reprisal because of similar destruction carried out by their military forces; and specifying the particular property for whose destruction it is a reprisal.


In any particular case, or in any particular district in which, in addition to such reprisals, it would seem desirable that: 
1. (a) The members of any particular family concerned should be ordered out of the country; or
2. (b) have their lands confiscated;


a special report should be submitted.

p.936


For the purposes of such reprisals no persons shall be regarded as enemies of Ireland, whether they may be described locally as Unionist, Orangemen, etc., unless they are actively anti-Irish in their actions.


No house shall be selected for destruction or destroyed without the personal approval and permission of the Brigade Commandant.


*By Order*


Adjutant-General.
