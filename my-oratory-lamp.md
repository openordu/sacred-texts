p.320


1. Lord! Thou hast kindled all Thy lamps to-night
  
For me, the lowliest parasite of earth;
  
Thy voice gave utterance, Thy will gave birth
  
To all these streaming galaxies of light.
  
If Thy creative word can thus delight
  
One who for ever travails from the dearth
  
Of love and knowledge, 'midst the boundless girth
  
That wraps Thee formless in the infinite,
  
Let me be generous with Thee, dear Lord!
  
Let me enkindle one bright lamp for Thee
  
Light for the light, the true Incarnate Word
  
A feeble flame for burning ecstacy.
  
Seest Thou, blind to star and glowing sun,
  
This lamp, that burns before Thine exiled one?
P.A. SHEEHAN
