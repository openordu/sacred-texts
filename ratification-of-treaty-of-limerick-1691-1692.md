Provided always, and our will and pleasure is, that these our letters patents shall be enrolled in our court of chancery in our said kingdom of Ireland within the space of one year next ensuing. In witness, etc., witness ourselves at **Westminster**, the twenty-fourth day of February, anno regni, regis et reginae Gulielmi et Mariae quarto *1691-2*. Per breve de privato sigillo. Nos autem tenorem premissorum predictorum, ad requisitionem attornati generalis domini regis et dominae reginae pro regno **Hiberniae**, duximus exemplificandum per presentes. In cujus rei testimonium has literas nostras fieri fecimus patentes. Testibus nobis ipsis apud Westmonasterium, quinto die Aprilis, annoque regni nostri quarto *1692*.
