#### Project Description


CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts


#### Sampling Declaration


The electronic edition represents odd pages 3–79, as well as Appendix C (82–85), D (86), E (87–92), F (93–140), 'Remarks on the Preceding Tract', pp 141–144, 147–183, Appendix I (327–351; 353–369 and 384–400). Henry Docwra's 'Relation of Service done in Irlande' on 187–229 and his 'Narration of the Services done by the Army ymployed to Lough-Foyle' on 233–286 are available on CELT in separate files. The editor's footnotes (designated with alphabetic letters by the editor) are numbered and tagged *note type="auth" n=""*.


#### Editorial Declaration


##### Correction


The Irish text has been proof-read twice.


##### Normalization


The electronic text represents the edited text in line with CELT practice. Text in languages other than the main text is marked. Normal CELT conventions have been applied in regard to text divisions, word segmentation, and capitalization in proper names. Fractions have been reproduced using /. Some typographical errors in the translation are corrected silently. Footnotes: John O'Donovan compiled hundreds of footnotes in his English translation of this Genealogy, and the accompanying appendix material, commenting on and explaining family names, place-names, details of Irish history and law, and other matters of interest. The notes are incorporated here. While O'Donovan used letters of the alphabet for the footnotes, in the CELT edition they have been numbered subsequently. Cross-references given by O'Donovan have been modified accordingly. The reproduction of genealogical tables within the footnotes has not been attempted. Instead, the relationships of the people mentioned in them have been described verbally at CELT. For the original tables readers are referred to the printed edition or the .pdf version available online (see bibliographic details below).


##### Quotation


Direct speech is tagged q. Citations are tagged cit. This element contains bibl and qt elements.


##### Hyphenation


Soft hyphens are silently removed. When a hyphenated word (hard or soft) crosses a page-break, or line-break this break is marked after the completion of the hyphenated word.


##### Segmentation


div0=the genealogy; div1=the section. Paragraphs are marked; page-breaks are marked pb n="". MS foliation of the original is not indicated in the printed edition. The back matter contains unnumbered divisions marked div.


##### Interpretation


Some group-names, place-names and personal names are tagged. Book titles are tagged. A selection of dates in appendix F is tagged.


#### Canonical References


This text uses the DIV1 element to represent the section. ### Profile Description

The History of the Race of Lughaidh, Son of Ith
-----------------------------------------------


Luigh-Ith,[1](javascript:footNote('T105009/note001.html')) i. e. Ith was smaller than his father, for Ith was the name of each of them; and these are the tribe of the Gaeidhil that
are not of the sons of Milidh,[2](javascript:footNote('T105009/note002.html')) nor of the Tuatha De Danann,[3](javascript:footNote('T105009/note003.html')) nor
of the Fir-Bolg,[4](javascript:footNote('T105009/note004.html')) nor yet of the Clann-Neimhidh;[5](javascript:footNote('T105009/note005.html')) and it may be said
that their invasion is not of the seven invasions,[6](javascript:footNote('T105009/note006.html')) for Ith was the first *of the Gaeidhil* that discovered Eire,[7](javascript:footNote('T105009/note007.html')) and it was through him that
the sons of Milidh came to inhabit therein, and widely did his *Ith's* tribe after him spread throughout Eire[8](javascript:footNote('T105009/note008.html')) and Alba.[9](javascript:footNote('T105009/note009.html')) For it is boasted

that Maccon[10](javascript:footNote('T105009/note010.html')) obtained sway over the world, and it is certain that he conquered the west of Europe without doubt, i. e. Alba, France, Saxonland, and the Island of Britain. And it is boasted concerning Daire Sirchreachtach[11](javascript:footNote('T105009/note011.html')) that he obtained sway over all the west of Europe; and
some of the learned say that he won the whole world. It is stated that
Fathadh Canann[12](javascript:footNote('T105009/note012.html')) obtained the government of the whole world from the
rising to the setting sun, and (if it be true) that he took hostages of
the streams, the birds, and the languages. And five kings of this tribe
took the kingdom of Ireland without doubt, namely, Eochaidh Opthach,[13](javascript:footNote('T105009/note013.html')) 
Eochaidh Eadghothach,[14](javascript:footNote('T105009/note014.html')) Maccon,[15](javascript:footNote('T105009/note015.html')) and the two Fathadhs,

the Royal Champion, who won [that part of] the world from Breatain-

And not this alone, but they possessed Munster alternately from the time of Daire and Dergtheneadh to the time of Oilill Olum[24](javascript:footNote('T105009/note024.html')) and Maicniadh. And the three

The three Fothadhs, namely, Fothadh Airctheach, Fothadh Cairptheach, i. e. Fothadh Canann, and Fothadh Dolus, were the three sons of Fuinnche, daughter of Nar, son of Fearmora of the Ara-Cliach. Teite, daughter of Maicniadh, son of Lughaidh, son of Daire Dearg, son of Gnathal, son of Nuadhat Neacht, son of Seatna Sithbhaic was her sister. Fuinnche brought forth together three male children, and they were the three sons of Feidhlimidh, son of Maicniadh, son of Gnathal, son of Maermaith, son of Cairbre Nia Nair, or Nia-fhear, whereon a certain poet sung:

Other books state that they were of the race of the Ui-Eachach of Uladh,[248](javascript:footNote('T105009/note248.html')) i. e. Irial Glunmhar, son of Conall Cearnach, had two sons, namely, Forc and Iboth. Recht-ghidh Righ-dhearg led them into Alba. They gained great battles, so that great districts were laid waste in Alba, until the men of Alba submitted to Reacht-ghidh Righ-dhearg, so that he was king of Eire and Alba, and it was from them sprang the two tribes Tuath Forc and Tuath Iboth[249](javascript:footNote('T105009/note249.html')) in Alba. Three times fifty men came over from thence in exile, and they took Cluithrin Cliach,[250](javascript:footNote('T105009/note250.html'))
and the land on which they are seated at this day. And they took
Crich-Maine, and Crich-Fiachrach, and Crich-Baiscinn as the heirs of their grandfather, namely, of Eochaidh, son of Luchta, viz. *the heirs* of Uaithne and Eile, the two daughters of Eochaidh, son of Luchta. The country of Eile extended from the Sinainn[251](javascript:footNote('T105009/note251.html')) east and south, and the country of Uaithne from the Sinainn north-west to Derg-dhearc,[252](javascript:footNote('T105009/note252.html')) and the tribes are called from the names of these women; for the one, i. e. Eile, went *as wife* to Caela Righ-dhearc, king of Eile and Bladhma,[253](javascript:footNote('T105009/note253.html')) and from her Eile is named. The other, i. e. Uaithne went *as wife* to Fearrghus Foltleabhar, and from her Uaithne is named. She had four sons called Nias, viz. Uarth-Nia, Druth-Nia, Cainn-Nia, and Deoch-Nia. Oeth-Nia, Cainn-Nia, and Deoch-Nia were three *full* brothers, and these are they who are there.


Maicniadh, the father of the Fothadhs, was the son of Cairbre, son of Cormac, son of Mesinsuadh, son of Mesinfuirc, son of Mesinforgaill, son of Meanboth. Others say that they were the three sons by Feidhlimidh of the fair hair of Feidhlimidh, son of Niadh, son of Gnathal, son of Earcmar, son of Cairbre, son of Cairbre Nia-fhear. From him is Leithghleann-Erc, and of him it was permitted that there was no greater royal heir. Erc, son of Feidlimidh, was drowned in a
lake, i. e. *Loch* Feidhlime.[254](javascript:footNote('T105009/note254.html'))

Nuadhat Neacht had three sons, namely, Gnathaltach, grandfather of the Fothadhs, and Baiscne, grandfather of Finn Ua Baiscne,[255](javascript:footNote('T105009/note255.html')) and Fearghus Fairrge, ancestor of the kings of Leinster, as the poet says:

### Appendix A

### LUGHAIDH MAL.


He was one of the sons of Daire Sirchreachtach, as appears from the following story given concerning him and his brothers in the **Dinnseanchus** in the Book of Leacan, fol. 256, a.b. voce CARN MAIL. ‘Carnn Mail in Magh Uladh whence was it named? It is not difficult to tell. It was otherwise called Carnn Luighdheach, from Lughaidh Mal, who was driven from Eire with a fleet of seven ships, and from Alba he set out for Eire with the great fleet of Alba; and they gave battle to the Ulstermen and defeated them. Every man that came into battle with Lughaidh carried a stone, and thus the **carn** was formed, and it was on it Lughaidh was standing[256](javascript:footNote('T105009/note256.html')) while the battle was fought. Whence Carn Lughaidh is called.’

### Lughaidh Laighdhe and the other Sons


The following account of Lughaidh Laidhe and his brothers is given in the Coir Anmann[264](javascript:footNote('T105009/note264.html')), as in the Book of Leacan, fol. 222b–223a —
  

‘Lughaidh Laidhe and the other sons, &c. Let it be here enquired whence the additional names upon the sons of Daire Doimthigh, i. e. the five Lughaidhs, and what is the reason that each was called Lughaidh? It is not difficult to tell. It had been prophesied that one of his sons would assume the sovereignty of Eire, and that Lughaidh would be his name, wherefore each of the sons was named Lughaidh. The fair of Tailltin was celebrated by Daire, and his sons performed their horsemanship there; and the Druid said, ‘what good are thy sons, only one of them shall assume the monarchy of Eire.’ Daire said to the Druid: ‘What son shall assume the sovereignty after me?’ ‘A fawn with the bright color of gold shall arrive at the fair,’ said the Druid, ‘and the son who shall overtake the fawn is he who shall assume the sovereignty of Eire after thee.’ And the golden fawn arrived afterwards at the fair, and the men of Eire went in pursuit of it, and the sons of Daire followed it from thence to Beann Eadair, and a magical mist *[here]* arose between them and the men of Eire. The sons of Daire pursued it from thence to Dal-Meascorb, in Leinster, and Lughaid Laidhe, i. e. Maicniadh, overtook the fawn, and *[another]* Lughaidh had the flaying of the fawn, and hence is (called) Lughaidh Cosc. And a great snow afterwards fell, so that it was *[great]* work for them to carry or hold their arms. And one of them went in search of a house, and he found a large house with a great fire therein, and food and drink in abundance, and dishes of silver and beds of **Findruine** *[German silver]*; and there was a large hideous hag in the house. ‘O young man, what dost thou seek?’ said she. ‘A bed till morning,’*[replied the youth.]* And she said, ‘if thou wilt come into my bed or couch to-night, thou shalt obtain it.’ And the youth said that he would not, and he went out to his brothers. ‘Thou hast refused sovereignty and monarchy,’ said she. The other brothers went in after him. She

asked of another man of them why he had come, and he said ‘for a wild hog, and I have eaten it alone.’ ‘Lughaidh Orca shall be thy name among thy tribe,’ said she. She asked the same of another man. ‘Nothing,’ said he, ‘fell to my lot, but I fell asleep.’ ‘That was sleepy,’ said she, ‘and Lughaidh Cal shall be thy name among thy tribe,’ said she. She asked the same of another man. ‘A wild fawn presented itself to me,’ said he. ‘Lughaidh Laidhe shall be thy name among thy tribe, and thus it is.’ Another man came to her and she asked him the same. ‘What they have left I have eaten,’ says he. ‘Lughaidh Corb shall be thy name,’ said she, ‘for corrupt is the thing thou hast taken.’ Lughaidh Laidhe was the last who went into the house, and the hag said the same to him. ‘I met an ox,’ said he, ‘and I devoured it alone.’ ‘Lughaidh Laidhe shall be thy name,’ said she, ‘among thy tribe.’ Wherefore these names clung to them. At length Lughaidh Laidhe *[Maicniadh]* went with her into the house for food and drink. After this the hag lay down in the bed of **findruine**, and Maicniadh lay down after her in the bed, and it appeared to him that the light of her countenance was as the sun rising in the month of May, and the fragrance of her was as the smell of a flower garden. After this he cohabited with her, and she said, ‘Good is thy journey,’ said she, ‘for I am the sovereignty, and thou shalt obtain Eire or one descended of thee shall.’ They afterwards took new viands and old drinks, and cups were distributed to them alone, and he cohabited with the sovereignty. And in the morning they were without house or fire except the level mountain side, and their hounds were tied to their lances. After this they returned to the fair of Tailltin, and related the story of their adventures, and the men of Eire dispersed from the fair:
whence it is said, the five Lughaidhs.’

### Appendix C

### The Family of Dun-Cairbre

#### (From the Irish Penny Journal, pp. 241–42, 30th January, 1841)


The Castle of Dun-garbry, or properly Dun-Cairbre, signifying the Dun or Fort of Cairbre, is situate on a hill, on the south side, and not far from the mouth, of the Drowis, or Drobhaeis—a river very celebrated in Irish history—and the estuary of the beautiful Loch Melghe, (Melvin,) in the lower part of the county of Leitrim, bordering on the county of Sligo. Though marked on the maps made in the reign of Elizabeth as an important fortress, its ruins are now but inconsiderable, and consist only of a side wall perforated by an arched doorway. But, trivial as these vestiges are, they impart some historic interest to scenery of the most delightful character by which it is surrounded, and are valuable as a memorial of an ancient Irish family, once of great rank in the county, though now reduced to utter decay, at least in their original locality.


Dun-Cairbre Castle was erected by the chief of the Mac-Clanchys, or correctly Mac Fhlannchadha, a sept or clan who possessed the ancient district called Dartraidhe, the present barony of Rossclogher, and of which the Castle of Rossclogher, situate on an island in Loch Melghe, was their chief residence. The name of its founder and the date of its erection are not preserved; but the latter may with probability be referred to a period anterior to the reign of Henry VIII, as the Annals of the Four Masters record, at the year 1538, the death of a chieftain of Dun-Cairbre.


It may be proper to state that there are in Ireland two perfectly distinct families of the name Mac Fhlannchadha, or, as it is now more usually written, Clancy; first, the family of Thomond or Clare, some of whom were hereditary Brehons or judges to the O'Briains, and who were a branch of the Mac Conmaras (Mac-na-maras;) and, secondly, the family of Dartraidhe, who were hereditary chiefs of that district from a very remote period.

p.83


The notices of the chiefs of this family, as preserved in the Irish Annals from the twelfth till the seventeenth century, will serve to convey a very vivid impression of the insecurity of life resulting from the unsettled state of society, and its retrogression towards absolute barbarism during this unhappy period of our history, and will teach us also to appreciate the blessings we derive from the progress which civilization has made within the last century.


1241. Domhnall Mag Fhlannchadha, chief of Dartraighe, died.


1274. Cathal Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dartraighe, died.


1278. Ruaidhre, son of Toirrdhealbhach O'Concobhair, was slain by Gilla-Crisd Mag Fhlannchaidh and the inhabitants of Dartraighe, on he borders of Drum-Cliabh.


1301. William Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dartraighe, was slain by Ualgharg, the son of Domhnall, son of Art O'Ruairc.


1303. Among these (the slain) was Muirceartach Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dartraighe.


1337. Tadhg Mac Fhlannchadha, lord of Dartraighe, was slain by Corbmac, the son of Ruaidhre, son of Domhnall O'Concobhair, as were also numbers of others, in revenge of Seaan, the son of Domhnall. Great depredations were afterwards committed in Dartraighe by O'Concobhair, and the son of Muiris Mag Fhlannchaidh was killed while in pursuit of the prey.


1349. Aedh O'Ruairc defeated Flaithbheartach O'Ruairc, Donnchadh O'Domhnaill, and the people of Dartraighe. Aedh Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dart-raighe, Gilla-Crist Mag Fhlannchadha, Lochlann, son of Aindilis O'Baeighill, and many others, were slain in the engagement.


1366. The O'Ruaircs went on a migratory excursion, accompanied by the people of Fearmanach; but the youths of Clann Muircheartach attacked and surrounded them, and killed Cathal Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dartraighe.


1418. Tadhg, i.e. Mag Fhlannchadha, the son of Cathal, the son of Tadhg, chief of Dartraighe, died, having retired into a monastery, a fortnight previously; and his son Cathal assumed his place.


1420. Cathal, son of Tadhg Mag Fhlannchadha, chief of Dartraighe, was slain in his own house, together with Aedh Buidhe Mag

Fhlannchadha, about the festival of Brighid; by their own kinsmen, the brothers Tadhg, Muiris, and Enri.


1421. A nocturnal attack was made by Cathal O'Ruairc and his sons upon Mag Fhlannchaidh, on Inis Caein [an island] in Loch Melghe [Melvin]; and the guards of the lake, namely, the Mag Gollaighs [Mac Galloglai] delivered up the boats of the lake to Cathal and his sons. And Mag Fhlannchaidh Og was taken prisoner by them; and they took possession of Loch Melghe and its castle. Five of the sons of Mag Fhlannchaidh, and a great number of the men of Dartraighe were slain by them, after which [the rest of] the sons of Mag Fhlannchaidh went to Cairbre.


1532. Toirrdhealbhach, the son of Mag Fhlannchaidh, was killed by his own two brothers, on the threshold of Mag Fhlannchaidh's mansion; and Brian O'Ruairc destroyed much in Dartraighe, on account [i.e. in revenge] of this killing.


1536. Mag Fhlannchaidh, chief of Dartraighe, i.e. Fearadhach, the son of William, died. He was a charitable and humane man.


1538. The son of Mag Fhlannchaidh, Cathaeir, the son of Fearadach, the son of William, heir of the chieftainship of Dartraighe, died at Dun-Cairbre.


1578. Mag Fhlannchaidh of Dartraighe died: that is, Cathal Dubh, the son of Fearadhach, and his son, Cathal Og, assumed his place.


1582. Mag Fhlannchaidh of Dartraighe (i.e. Cathal Og) was slain by his own kinsman, Tadhg Og.


It appears from an inquisition taken at the Abbey of Creevelea, on the 24th September, 1603, that Cathal Og Mac Clanchy died on the 3rd of January, 1582, seised of the castle and manor of Dun-cairbre, and of the whole country called Mac Clanchy's country, leaving a son and heir, Cathal Dubh, then aged twenty-eight years.


It appears, however, that, in accordance with the Brehon law, the chieftainship of Dartraidhe passed at his death not to his son, but to the eldest surviving representative of the name, as an inquisition, taken at Rossclogher on the 3d of October in the same year, finds that the greater part of the country, including the castle of Dun-cairbre, and the castle and chief town of Rossclogher, &c were in the possession

p.85



of Malaghlin Mac Clanchy, who died so seised on the 13th of August, 1603, leaving a son and heir, Cahir Mac Clanchy, three years and ten months old at the time of his father's death; and it is stated that all these castles, lands, &c. were held of the king by knight's service in capite, but the quantity of the service was not ascertained by the inquisitors. By the will of this Malaghlin Mac Clanchy he bequeathed to his son and heir, Cahir, all his lands except such as were nominated wife's jointure; and to his wife, Katherine Ny Rourke, who was found to have been his legitimate consort, he bequeathed his Castle of Dun-garbry, as also his chief town called Rossclogher, in pawn of her marriage goods, until his heir should redeem it.


The property of the Mac Clanchys was confiscated after the rebellion of 1641, but their name is the prevailing one in the barony of Dartraidhe, or Rossclogher, to the present day.

### Appendix D

### Pedigree of *Ó* h-Eidirsceoil Or O'Driscoll.


It is a very extraordinary fact that the pedigree of O'Driscoll, as given by all the Irish Genealogical Manuscripts now accessible, is less correct than any other line. It is in fact more than forty generations short from Lughaidh, son of Ith, down to Lughaidh Maccon, monarch of Ireland in the third century, but from that period forward it is as correct as any of the lines deduced from Oilill Olum. This fact, which has not been acknowledged by any of our critics or genealogists, may help to fix the real period at which the Spanish colony of the Clann-Breogain settled in Ireland, but this is not the place to discuss such a question.


Maccon, the last O'Driscoll given in the Book of Leacan, died, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, in the year 1418, and was therefore the reigning chief of Corca-Laidhe, when the Book of Leacan was compiled. The line has been continued till the beginning of the seventeenth century, by **Keating**[265](javascript:footNote('T105009/note265.html')), the Four Masters, Dubhaltach Mac Firbisigh, and in a manuscript in the British Museum, (Harl. 1425, p. 25.)

### Appendix E

### Corca Laidhe


(The Society have been favored with the following note by the Rev. John Quarry, Rector of Clonakilty.)


Corca Laidhe, the territory of the O'Driscolls, is described in the Book of Leacan and Book of Ballymote[267](javascript:footNote('T105009/note267.html')) as comprising originally the entire of the Diocese of Ross, and as extending from Beann-Fhinn to the Strand of Traigh-Omna, and thence westward to Frith-na-h-Imghona, and from a Ford called Beal-atha-buidhe to the Strand called Traigh-Claen where there is a great rock. Where Beann-Fhinn is situate I have been unable to ascertain; at least no place is now known by this name. But immediately over the present Church of Castleventry, nearly in the centre of the entire district described, there is a lofty hill called Knockfeen, I suppose properly Cnoc-Finn. The summit of this, which is a prominent point, might be intended by the name Beann-Fhinn, from whence the extent is measured in a south-westerly direction to Traigh-Omna, which is the present name of a Strand at the extreme south-west of the Parish of Castlehaven. Westward from this is an inlet called Lough Hina, which I have no doubt is a corruption of the ancient name as it appears in Frith-na-h-Imghona. This designation is very applicable to the district along the sea beyond Lough Hina, which is still unreclaimed as may be seen by the Ordnance Map. The place which I suppose to be Frith-na-h-Imghona is known by the name of Glanawhine, probably a corruption of another compound containing the same name. The Ford called Beal-atha-buidhe is on the Bandon river, and is still known by the same name. It is noted for a great fair, and is a central point on the north of the entire district. From thence the extent is measured in a south-easterly direction to the extreme eastern boundary of the district, the Broad Strand or Traigh-Claen, still known by this name, outside Court-mac-Sherry Bay. Off one extremity of this Strand is a dangerous rock known by the name of the Horse Rock, the great rock mentioned in the description. These,



---

p.88



together with the other identified localities, will be found marked on the accompanying map.


The district thus described is not exactly conterminous with the Diocese of Ross, which it is said to have comprised; as will be seen by the dotted line on the map which marks the northern boundary of the present Diocese, another district of which lies entirely separated from this beyond Bantry. The name Corca-Laidhe still exists in the corrupted form Cothluidhe, which name however is now confined to two small districts called Cothluidhe-mor and Cothluidhe-beag, situate on either side of the river Ilen near Skibbereen. This name is known to the country people though not appearing in the maps.


I. A subdivision of this territory is called the country of O'Gillamichil, and is described as extending from Tuath-na-h-Imghona aforesaid to the head of a harbour or inlet called Ceann-mara, and from Beann-t-Sidhain to Beal-atha-na-Seamann. Ceann-mara is the present name of the head or inmost part of the harbour of Castlehaven. Beann-t-Sidhain is the highest cliff on the Southern Coast of the Parish of Castlehaven, as still known by this name. I have not been able to find any name exactly corresponding to Beal-atha-na-Seamann. There is a ford over a stream falling into the river Ilen north of Skibbereen, called Ath-na-Seang, which might be a corruption of the name. But it more probably designates some ford over the Saivenose falling into the same river. In **Smith**'s History of Cork, written more than a century back, this stream is called Savenesag. The latter part of this name as thus written is probably a corruption of **uisge**, ‘water’, and then the former part might represent Seamann by the (*m*) assuming an aspirate. And this is the more likely to be the stream on which is the ford in question, as we shall find that the next division also terminates with a ford over the same stream, which would thus form a natural boundary to this part of the territory. The Parish of Castlehaven, called also Gleann-Bearchan, forms a large part of this division. St. Bearchan is reputed to have been a prophet, one of his predictions, prior to the invasion of the Danes, having been that the Easterlings would come. There is a place in this Parish called Killchangil or Gillahangil, which probably contains a reminiscence of O'Gillamichil, ‘the big Vicar.’




---

p.89


II. The next division called Tuath O'Coinned or the Garrdha, is described as extending from Ceann-mara, already identified, to Loch-an-Bhricin, and from Miross to the ford of Beal-atha-soluis. The Parish of Miross is still known to the country people by the name of Garry or the Garden, which is said to have formerly designated a larger district. Miross itself is situate a little west of the head of the harbour of Glandore. There is a ford over the Saivenose already mentioned, still known by the name of Ath-Soluis, and Loch-an-Bhricin is the present designation of a lake situate a little east of Glandore harbour.


III. The subdivision next to the Garry is called Tuath-Rois, which is plainly the district of Ross, or Tuath-Indolaigh, of which name a trace is to be found in the name of a rock in the Bay of Ross, west of the Gally Head, which is known to the country people by the designation of Carraigin Indolaigh, or in an abbreviated form Doolig. This district is described as extending from Loch-an-Bhricin already mentioned to Fidh-Ruis, and from the Strand of Traigh-long to the hill called Sidh-na-bh-fear-finn. Fidh-Ruis is no doubt the wooded and wild country immediately west of Ross, as implied by this descriptive and still applicable designation. Traigh-long is the present name of the Strand in a cove into which a stream falls from Loch-an-Bhricin. The lake is on high ground from which there is a great descent to a bog immediately inside the strand. This bog is lower than the sea, and passes under a white shingle for some distance into the water, which has in consequence the color of turf, and appears very remarkable when the sea is rough. I have not been able to discover any trace whatever of the name of the hill called Sidh-na-bh-fear-finn.


Iveleary, to which O'Leary is said to have removed, after the English invasion, from this district of which he was chief, is situate near Macroom; as also the Castle of Carraig-na-Corra. The first named in the list of his followers, O'Ruaidhre, probably gave name to the little river now called Rowry, which runs through this division a little to the east of Loch-an-Bhricin and Traigh-long.


IV. The next subdivision called Tuath O'n-Aenghusa is said to have extended from Fearsad-Ruis to the inlet called Goilin-na-Gaithneamhna, 



---

p.90



and from Dun-Deide to Beal-atha-na-leice. Fearsad-Ruis, I suppose the strandpits of Ross, exactly describes the inlet at the west of the head of which Ross is situate, being choked at the entrance by sand, and when the tide is out presenting a muddy surface filled with pools of water left by the tide. Goilin-na-Gaithneamhna is the Goleen or inlet of Gahami, as it is now called, this being the name of the lands surrounding a little bay east of the Gally Head, called Traigh-Gahami, and also the Red Strand from a reddish-colored sand, famous all over this country for its fertilizing properties, and therefore drawn to great distances for manure. Dun-Deide is the peninsula which forms the Gally Head; the place where it joins the mainland was strongly fortified by the Castle of Dundeide, as it is still called. Close to this are very remarkable caves into which the sea runs, and boats can penetrate a great distance. One of them has an opening inland, through which in great storms the waves are thrown up. There is no place in this territory now known by the name of Beal-atha-na-leice, though there is a place so called near Bantry. A line, however, drawn from Dundeide to the northern part of the territory somewhat parallel to the lines which mark the extent of the preceding divisions in the same direction, reaches a Lake called Curraghalicky. A stream runs into this from the west, and proceeds from it in a north-easterly direction to the Bandon River. Dropping the former part of this name, Curragh, which I suppose is descriptive of the Lake, a ford over the stream would probably be called Beal-atha-na-leice. And as we shall have reason to think that the stream passing north eastward from the Lake is the boundary of the next division, Beal-atha-na-leice was probably over the stream at the west, perhaps where Curraghalicky-bridge is now situate.


V. The next division called Tuath O'Fithcheallaigh or O'Feehily's country is said to have extended from Goilin-na-Gaithneamhna already ascertained, to the Island of Inis-duine, and from Dun-Eoghain to Glaise-Droighneach. Inis-duine, or Inchydoney, is an Island in Clonakilty Bay, which constitutes a Prebend in Ross Cathedral. The point of it which projects farthest into the sea is called ‘the Virgin Mary's Point,’ and on its summit are the impressions of a pair of knees supposed to have been made by the blessed Virgin herself.



---

p.91



However they were first made, there is no miracle in their preservation, as the people are in the habit of resorting to the spot and kneeling on them whilst offering a prayer. Dunowen is the name of a townland on the southern coast east of the Red Strand already identified with Goilin-na-Gaithneamhna. The remains of a castle, from which it takes the first part of the name, still exist. A line from Dunowen, parallel to those which measure the extent of the preceding divisions in a north-westerly direction, will reach the stream which runs from the eastern extremity of Curraghalickey Lake to the Bandon River. This stream bounds the lands of Drinagh in the Parish of Drinagh. We may safely assume that this name was originally spelled Droighneach, and that therefore the stream was called in the description of the territory Glaise-Droighneach.


The Parish of Ardfield on the southern coast of this division, taking the first part of the name from the great elevation of the ground on which the Church is built, which rises from the sea in very lofty and precipitous cliffs, contains in the latter part, no doubt, a corruption of the name of O'Fithcheallaigh, the chief of the district. Another remnant of the same is perhaps to be found in the name of the little stream which runs in a south-easterly direction to the town of Clonakilty, and was probably the boundary between this and the next subdivision. The name of this stream as given on the Ordnance Map is Fealge, but this spelling is of course arbitrary, and the name is commonly pronounced Feely or Feehily, and seems to be a corruption of Fithcheallaigh.


VI. The next subdivision is called Tuath-na-Donn-ghalaigh, and extends from Inis-duine, already mentioned, to Beal-atha-na-h-Uidhre, and from Greallach-na-g-Cruime to Achadha. Beal-atha-na-h-Uidhre is a ford over the River Airgidin, (silver stream, in sound and sense like Homer's APGUPODINE,) about five miles westward from Clonakilty. It is known by this name as a place where two priests were murdered, in consequence of some matrimonial affair, and whose bodies were found in the river adjacent to the ford. Greallach-na-g-Cruime is now known only in the former part of the name. There are two places called Greallach or Grillach, either of which may have been intended. One is a townland on the Bandon River a little east of Ballybuy

p.92



already mentioned. This would carry the present division up to the northern boundary of the whole territory to which it probably extended. The other is on the River Airgidin, about a mile and half north of Clonakilty, and would serve as a point from which to measure the extent in an easterly direction, as the line from Inis-duine to Beal-atha-na-h-Uidhre does in a westerly. Achadha is the present name of a townland a short space inland from the Broad Strand or Traigh-claen, which has been already mentioned as the eastern limit of the territory as it is also of this division.


Amongst the followers of O'Domhnaill, the chief of this division, is mentioned O'h-Aedha of Cluain-da-Mhael. About a mile west from Clonakilty is the site of an ancient castle which stood upon a bold rock over a ford. The Castle belonged to the O'Heas, and the place is now called Aghamilla. The former part of this name being derived from the ford (ath), the latter might present some trace of the word which forms the latter part of Cluain-da-Mhael. This Castle was battered by Cromwell's forces, and only a small remnant of the foundation is now perceptible. A farmer, whose family has been long settled in the immediate vicinity, possesses a cannon ball found by one of his ancestors in the dyke of the roadside. The tradition is that the people were assembled to dance on a Sunday evening, when the battering commenced from a hill on the other side of the Castle, and that it fell almost immediately, being extremely ancient. O'Sealbhaigh is also mentioned, and this name is perhaps still retained in the small parish and the lands of Kilsallagh near Courtmacsherry within this division.


VII. The last division of the territory is called Tuath-Ui-Duibh-da-leith, and is said to have extended from Beal-atha-na-h-Uidhre to Beal-atha-buidhe, both already mentioned, and from Gortnadiha to Loch-an-Tairbh. Gortnadiha is a denomination of land very near Kilmeen Church, and Loch-an-Tairb or Lough-atariff, as it is commonly called in English, is a Lake in the western border of the Parish of Kilmeen.

### Appendix F


On the 4th of September, 1368, the Poers of the County of Waterford, having gathered all their forces, and being joined by O'Hedriscol of the County of Cork, and his gallies and men, sailed towards Waterford with an intention to plunder the city, which the Poers bore a great enmity to, on account of their fidelity and good government. John Malpas then Mayor, being informed of their designs, prepared to resist them, and accompanied by Walter Devenish, Sheriff of the County, Richard Walsh, Master of St. John of Jerusalem, with a number of merchant strangers and English, set himself at their head, and sailed towards the enemy. But the event did not answer these preparations. For the Poers with the aid of the western gallies of the O'Hedriscols set upon the city forces, and routed them. In this battle the Mayor, with the Sheriff of the County, the Master of the Hospital, thirty-six of the most worthy Citizens, as also sixty merchant strangers and English were slain. On the other side, the head of the Poers called Baron of Don-Isle, his brother Bennet Poer, with many of that sept, and numbers of the O'Hedriscols fell. The day following the Mayor was brought to the city, all hewen and cut to pieces, and was buried in Christ Church, and Richard Brasborne was immediately elected Mayor in his room.— M.S. Clogher, in College Library. Natural and Civil History of Waterford, 1746, by Charles Smith, pp. 125, 126.


In the year 1413, Simon Wickin, Mayor of Waterford, Roger Walsh and Thomas Sault, Bailiffs, surprised and took prisoners, O'Hedriscol, his family, and the rest of his followers in his strong castle of Baltimore in the County of Cork. They took with them a strong band of men in armour, on board a ship belonging to the city, and arrived at the castle on Christmas day at night. The Mayor landed his men and marched up to the gate, and called to the porter, desiring him to tell his lord, that the Mayor of Waterford was come to the Haven with a ship of wine, and would gladly come in to see him; upon this message the gate was set open, and the whole family made prisoners. — M.S.

As divers of the King's subjects have been taken and slain by Finin O'Hedrischol, cheiftane of his nation, an Irish enemy, enacted, that no person of the ports, of Wexford, Waterford, &c. shall fish at Korkly Baltimore, nor go within the country of the said O'Hedrischol with victuals, arms, &c. and that proclamation be made of this by Writs in the parts aforesaid, under the penalty of the forfeiture of their goods, and ships to those who shall take them, and their persons to the King; and the town who receives the said O'Hedrischol or any of his men shall pay
£ 40 to the King. — M.S. Clogher Coll. Libr. Ibid. p. 129. See the Statute itself post, p. 98.


On the third of June, 1461, the Mayor and citizens of Waterford being informed of the arrival of O'Hedrischol at Tramore, invited there by the Powers, (who always continued their rancour to the city) prepared themselves in warlike manner, and set forwards towards Ballymacdane, where they met the O'Hedrischols and Powers, gave them
battle and gained a compleat victory, 160 of the enemy being slain, and some taken prisoners, among whom were O'Hedrischol Oge and six of his sons, who with three of their Gallies were brought to Waterford. — M.S. Clogher Coll. Libr. Ibid. p. 129.


On the 20th of February, 1537, four Portugal ships laden with Spanish wines, consigned to the merchants of Waterford, were driven by tempest to Cape Clear, Baltimore, and the old head of Kinsale. One of the ships called la Santa Maria de Soci, laden with 100 tun of wine, was driven into a bay adjoining to the entrance of the haven of Baltimore. Finen O'Hederischol Chieftane of the Island, Conogher his son, and Gilly Duffe his base son, came on board and covenanted with the Merchants for three pipes of wine, to conduct the ships safe into the haven. When the Gentry and Peers of those parts had tasted the wines, they forgot their safe conduct and invited the Merchants to dinner in the castle, seized and clapped them in irons, manned their Irish gallies and took the ship, and distributed 72 tuns of the wine among their neighbours.


On the 3rd of March news arrived of this action at Waterford. Immediately 24 men of the city with Pierce Dobbyn for their Captain, sailed in a Pichard, called the Sunday of Waterford, well armed, and the day following at noon arrived suddenly at the ship, and as

p.95



they boarded her on one side, Gilly Duff and twenty-four of his men fled out at the other. When the ship was won Pierce Dobbyn manned her, and set the prisoners at large, there remained of the wine twenty-five tuns and more, and taking a view of the castle they fired several guns at the great hall, and then sailed to Waterford.


On the 27th of the same month, the Mayor fitted out a little fleet consisting of the ship lately retaken, another large vessel, and the great galley of the city, well appointed with artillery, victuals, and men to the number of four hundred, and put them under the command of Bailiff Woodlock, as chief Captain, Pierce Dobbyn, James Walsh, James Sherlock, Henry Walsh and John Butler under Captains. On Wednesday the first of April at night they sailed, and arrived within the haven of Baltimore, and anchored towards the castle, which was guarded with men and artillery. They fired at it all night, and at the break of day the ward fled, and the Waterford men landed in good order in the island, and besieged the strong fortress there, the mariners entered the castle by the small port, and put up St. George's standard, and the army all entered at the Bridge-gate, and kept it five days, which they spent in destroying all the villages of the Island; and also the house of the Friers Minors near the castle, and the mill of the same. The fortress being double warded by two strong piles or castles, with walls, and barbicans, the halls, offices, &c. were totally ruined to the ground, and were tumbled into the sea. There was found in the island great store of malt, barley and salt. There was taken here Finen's cheif galley of thirty oars, and above three or four score pinances, of which about fifty were burned, and the great galley carried to Waterford. Near to Inishircan was an island called Inchipite, where Finen had his most pleasant seat in a castle, adjoining to a hall, with an orchard and grove, all which they destroyed and razed to the earth, and from thence they entered into another island, and burnt all the villages of the same. Then landing in the main they burnt and destroyed Baltimore, and broke down Teig O'Hederischol's goodly castle, and bawn.


On Tuesday in passion-week one William Grant was on the top of one of the castles, which being all on fire under him, he stood upon one of the pinnacles and cried out for help; Butler tied a small cord



---

p.96



to an arrow and shot it up to Grant, at which he drew up an hawser fastened to the cord, and fixing the hawser to the pinacle, slided down, and was received by his fellows on beds. After this, on Good Friday, the army arrived safe at Waterford. MS. Clogher, in Coll. Library. Ibid. pp. 140, 141. **Smith**'s Cork, Book III. ch. 2.

### Remarks on the Preceding Tract




---

p.141


Two ancient vellum copies of this work are in existence, one in Leabhar Leacain, (the Book of ‘Lecan’,) which was compiled from various other MSS. by **Gilla Isa Mor Mac Firbisigh** of Leacan, in the county of Sligo, in the year 1418. This copy begins at folio 119, b, b, and ends with folio 122, b, b. The other copy is preserved in Leabhar Bhaile an Mhuta, (the Book of ‘Ballymote’,) which was compiled by various persons, but chiefly by **Solamh O'Droma**, from older MSS. about the year 1390, for **Tomaltach Mac Donnchadha** (Mac Donough) then chief of the territories of Tir Oililla, Corann, Airteach, Tir Thuathail, and Clann Fearmaighe, extending into the counties of Sligo, Roscommon, and Leitrim. This copy begins at folio 109, b, b, and ends at 112, b.


There is also a copy of it which was transcribed on paper by **Dubhaltach Mac Firbisigh** in the year 1650, in the Library of Lord Roden, and a second paper copy made from the latter, by **Mr. E. Curry**, in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy.


Corca-Laidhe, the original country of the Dairinne, or O'Driscolls and their correlatives, was originally co-extensive with the diocese of Ross[272](javascript:footNote('T105009/note272.html')), or Ros-ailithre of which St. Fachtna of this race, who flourished in the sixth century, was the first bishop. But on the encrease of the power and population of the Deirgthine or race of Oilill Olum, the original territory of the Dairinne was much circumscribed. Long before the English Invasion the Ui-Eathach-Mumhan, or O'Mahonys, wrested from them that portion of their territory called Fonn-Iartharach i. e. West land, otherwise

Ivahagh, comprising the parishes of Kilmoe, Scoole, Kilcrohane, Durris, Kilmaconoge and Caheragh, in the barony of West Carbery; and after the English Invasion various encroachments were made upon their lands by the English, and by families of the race of Oilill Olum, then recently driven from their original locations by the English invaders. The Barrys encroached on the Eastern side of their principality; the O'Sullivans (Ui Suileabhain); who had been originally seated at Cnoc Raffonn and Cluain-meala, (Clonmel,) in the now county of Tipperary, were driven from thence in the year 1192, when they settled in the mountains of the now counties of Cork and Kerry, and finally wrested from the Dairinne or Corca-Laidhe, that portion of their territory now comprised in the baronies of Beare and Bantry. About the same period the Cairbre Aebhdha, or O'Donovans, O'Collins, &c. who had been seated in the barony of Cois Maighe, (Coshma,) and in the plain on the west side of the river Maigh, (Maigue,) in the now county of Limerick, were driven from thence by the Fitzgeralds, and they settled in the present county of Cork, and wrested from the Corca-Laidhe, a considerable portion of the northern part of their territory. This latter sept transferred their tribe name of Cairbre from the banks of the Maigh to the south of the Bandon, where it is still retained, applied to an extensive territory, now the four baronies of Carbery. The Corca-Laidhe, though circumscribed, were, however, independent of their new invaders, until the year 1232, when Cormac Gott, the third son of Mac Carthaigh Mor, acquired dominion over the entire region, now forming the four baronies of Carbery. This event is briefly noticed in the old copy of the Annals of Innisfallen, preserved in the Bodleian Library, as follows: [...][273](javascript:footNote('T105009/note273.html'))

p.143


*A.D. 1232. Domhnall God[274](javascript:footNote('T105009/note274.html')) Mac Carthaigh was taken prisoner by his own brother Cormac Mac Carthaigh, but he was set at liberty by him at the end of a quarter; and immediately after this Domhnall went at the instance of Maghnus O'Cobhthaigh and the daughter of O'Muircheartaigh (O'Moriarty) to commit an unneighbourly act against Muircheartach O'Mathghamhna, (O'Mahony,) a thing which he did, for he slew the three sons of O'Mathghamhna, and plundered himself; and, in consequence of this, Domhnall Cairbreach and his race remained in the south from that forth.’’*

 AI. , 1232.*2*.




The surrounding tribes still continued to encroach upon the Corca-Laidhe, until at length they narrowed their territory to the limits of the following parishes, which, according to the Regal Visitation Book of 1615, constitute the rural deanery of Colleymore and Colleybeg, viz.:
  

*Myross, Glanbarahane, (now Castlehaven,) Tullagh, Creagh, Kilcoe, Aghadowne and Cleere. In this territory they built the castles of Gleann, Bearchain, or Castlehaven, Lough-Hyne, Ardagh, Baltimore, Dun-na-n-gall, Dun-an-oir in Cape Clear Island, Rincoliskey, and a Castle and Abbey on Sherkine Island.’’*

as well as those of the O'Donovans, O'Mahonys, and several septs of the Mac Carthys paid tribute to MacCarthy Reagh—see Inquisition in Addenda F.


That the ancient Irish should have been careful to preserve their genealogies need not be a matter of surprise, and that these are perfectly authentic may be expected as they were entered in the local books of pedigrees, and preserved in the poems of family or hereditary poets. Those of the lowest rank among a great tribe, traced and retained the whole line of their descent with the same care, which in other nations was peculiar to the rich and great; for it was from his own genealogy each man of the tribe, poor as well as rich, held the charter of his civil state, his right of property in the cantred in which he was born, the soil of which was occupied by one family or clan, and in which no one lawfully possessed any portion of the soil if he was not of the same race with the chief.


This was also the case with the Welsh, as we are informed by **Giraldus**, in the first chapter of his Cambriae Descriptio, and again,
more particularly in the seventeenth chapter, where he writes as follows:
  

*Generositatem vero et generis nobilitatem prae rebus omnibus magis appetunt. Unde et generosa conjugia plus longe cupiunt quam sumptuosa vel opima. Genealogiam quoque generis sui etiam de populo quilibet observat, et non solum avos, atavos sed usque ad sextam vel septimam et ultra procul generationem memoriter et prompte genus enarrat in hunc modum, Resus filius Gruffini, filii Resi, filii Theodori, filii Aeneae, filii Oeni, filii Hoeli, filii Cadelli, filii Roderici Magni, et sic deinceps.
  

Genus itaque super omnia diligunt, et damna sanguinis atque dedecoris ulciscuntur. Vindicis enim animi sunt et irae cruentae, nec solum novas et recentes verum etiam veteres et antiquas velut instantes vindicare parati.’’*

### Remarks on the Preceding Poem


The preceding poem is now translated and printed for the first time. The text has been obtained from four copies, the only MSS of it known to the Editor, which are preserved the one in a parchment MS. the property of John Nugent, Esq. of Farranconnell, County of Cavan, and the others in paper MSS. the property respectively of the late O'Conor Don, the Royal Irish Academy, and Mr. Eugene Curry, all copied by very good scribes.


The poem itself, as stated in all the MSS., was composed by **Gilla Bhrighde Mac Conmidhe** (or **Gilbride Mac Namee**) who was chief poet of Ulster in his time, and the friend and follower of Brian O'Neill, King of the Irish of the North, and Righdhamhna or heir presumptive to the throne of Ireland. The family of Mac Conmidhe, of which this Gilla-Bhrighde was the head, were hereditary poets to the northern Ui-Neill, and are still very numerous in Ulster. Maelseachlainn Mac Conmidhe (Loughlin Mac Namee) of Draperstown Cross in the County of Derry, was believed to be the head of this family in 1835, when he told the Editor several anecdotes of his ancestors.


**Moryson** states that the family of O'Neill lived in obscurity till the time of Bruce, 1318, but this is not exactly correct as will appear from the history of the hero of this poem.


Brian O'Neill, the hero of this poem, became King of the Cineal Eoghain, in the year 1241, after having defeated and slain his predecessor, Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, prince of Tir Eoghain, in the battle of Caimeirge. From this period to the year 1248, the Annals are silent about his exploits, although it would appear from this poem that he was not idle. In 1248, he made an expedition into Fermanagh, carrying light currachs from Loch Feabhail (Lough Foyle) across the plain of Magh-Ithe and Tearmann Daibheog, and launched them on Loch Eirne, the islands of which he plundered, and demolished a stone castle which had evidently been erected by the English. In 1252, however, he and his brother submitted and gave hostages to Maurice Fitzgerald,

lord Justice of Ireland, who had marched with a numerous force to Cluain-Fiachna (Clonfeacle). In the same year O'Domhnaill (Gofraigh or Godfrey) made a preying excursion into Tir-Eoghain [Tyrone] and seized many cows and prisoners, but O'Neill (Brian) pursued and came up with him near the boundary of Tir-Conaill where a conflict ensued between the two fierce Races of Eoghan and Conall, in which the former were defeated with the loss of many men and prisoners of distinction. This aggression on the part of O'Domhnaill created a dissention between the two Races, which very much weakened the power of the Irish of Ulster. In the year 1257 O'Domhnaill came to a pitched battle with Maurice Fitzgerald, the lord Justice at Creadran-cille in Ros-Cede near Sligo, in which he gained the victory after a desperate conflict; and after having engaged the lord Justice in single combat, in which both were severely wounded; and he followed up his success by driving the Geraldines and all the English from his borders, and demolished a castle which they had erected at Cael-Uisce near Belleek, on Loch Eirne, for securing their conquests in that country. After this brilliant success O'Domhnaill lived but one year during which he was lying on his bed (in an island in Loch Beitheach) suffering from the severe wounds which he had received in the battle of Creadran-cille.


When O'Neill received intelligence of his feeble condition, he collected his forces to invade Tir-Conaill, and sent messengers to O'Domhnaill to demand submission and hostages from the Cineal-Conaill, as now they had no chief capable of leading them to battle. The messengers, on delivering their embassy to O'Domhnaill, and receiving an answer that O'Domhnaill's people would not submit to O'Neill, returned to O'Neill with all possible speed.


O'Domhnaill now ordered the Race of Conall to assemble from all quarters and come to him; and after they had assembled at his summons, he ordered them to construct for him the bier in which his body should be finally carried to the grave, and to carry him in it in the midst of his people. This was accordingly done; and he exhorted his people to exert their bravery, and keep up their spirits, for that he himself, though feeble from his wounds, would once more lead them to victory. The Cineal Conaill then proceeded on their march against O'Neill's forces and met them near the mouth of the river Suileach

[the Swilly.] Here a fierce battle was fought between the kindred races, in which the Race of Eoghan were defeated and driven back, leaving behind them many men, horses, and much valuable property. The Cineal Conaill then set out for home, but on their arrival at the village of Congbhail [Conwal] in Gleann Suillighe, O'Domhnaill became very sick, and ordered the bier in which he was carried to be laid down on the street, and here he died the death of a hero, the wounds which he had received in his combat with Maurice Fitzgerald in the battle of Creadran-cille having bled afresh in this battle.


When O'Neill heard of the death of O'Domhnaill he again sent messengers to the Cineal Conaill to demand submission and hostages. Thereupon the Cineal Conaill held a council, to deliberate on what they should do, and whom they would elect as their chief. While they were deliberating on these subjects, Domhnall Og, the son of Domhnall Mor, presented himself at the meeting, having just arrived from Scotland where he was fostered. This noble youth, who was the son of Domhnall by the daughter of Cathal Croibh-dhearg O'Conchobhair (Charles the Redhanded O'Conor,) king of Connacht, was then in his eighteenth year, and was inaugurated at Cill Mic Neanain [Kilmacrenan] by O'Firghil, the Comharba of that Church and the subchiefs of Tir-Conaill. He conferred with O'Neill's emissaries in the Gaelic of Alba, and pronounced the demands of O'Neill as extravagant and exorbitant, and said in Erse ‘that every man should have
his own world.’


O'Neill's ambition, however, was not lessened by this answer, for he made every effort to become not only sovereign of Ulster but even monarch of Ireland. In the same year he marched with his forces to Cael-Uisce on the borders of Tir-Conaill, where he held a conference with Hugh son of Felim O'Conor, king of Connacht, and Tadhg O'Briain, king of Thomond, and here, according to the Annals of Ulster and Clonmacnoise, the sovereignty of the Irish of Ireland was conferred on Brian O'Neill, and Hugh O'Conor delivered him hostages, and he received also the hostages of the O'Reillys, and of all the Ui-Briuin from Kells to Drumcliff. But a somewhat different account of this conference is given in the Caithreim Thoirdhealbhaigh, or Wars of Toirdhealbhach O'Briain, and in the Dublin copy of the

Annals of Innisfallen, in which it is incorrectly entered under the year 1252. It is stated in these works, that a general convention of the princes and nobility of Ireland assembled at Cael Uisge on the brink of Loch Eirne, in order to elect a supreme king over the Irish, to suppress the tyranny and usurpation of the English. Tadhg, son of Conchobhar na Siudaine O'Briain, repaired thither with most of the nobles of Munster and Connacht, and on his arrival at Cael Uisge, sent northwards across the river one hundred steeds as wages in token of vassalage to O'Neill. O'Neill, enraged at this offer, sent back the horses and two hundred steeds with golden bridles as wages to O'Briain, who refused to accept of them; and the consequence was that the meeting was broken up without choosing an ard-righ, or sole monarch for that time.


It looks very strange that neither **Leland** nor Moore should have noticed this attempt of the Irish chieftains to unite against the English, for, although the result was insignificant, the attempt had it succeeded would have proved disastrous to the English in Ulster.


The following is the account of the meeting at Cael Uisge given in the Caithreim Thoirdhealbhaigh:

> The foreigners, through much pride and haughtiness with which they were filled and inflated, were exerting tyranny, injustice, captivity and constant depredation upon the Gaeidhil and taking their cattle and their lands from them with violence wherever they were able. And when the Gaeidhil perceived this, they wished to free themselves from that cruel tyranny of the foreigners by electing one sovereign over them to whom they should all yield hostages, that they might by this means defend Eire as they were accustomed to do. Wherefore they came to the resolution of holding a conference with each other on the margin of the deep harboured islandful Eirne. Here the nobles and chief lords of the Gaeidhil of Eire assembled together.

It was a custom formerly that whenever the King [chief] of a Trícha chéd, or of a province, would receive a gift or wages from another great chief, he thereby signified that he became a subject and a vassal to him, as his lord, and that he was to pay him rent and tribute. After these nobles had sat in the assembly O'Briain sent one hundred steeds northwards across the stream in the name of wages to O'Neill; and when O'Neill perceived this he, with great violent anger, ordered to be sent across the same stream two hundred steeds with their gold-ornamented white-bordered bridles, which he had collected for bestowing on the men of Eire at this meeting on account of his right and power beyond any other of the Gaeidhil to contest for Eire, and moreover because all the men of Ulster were obedient to him at that time. When the noble Tadhg saw these steeds with their bridles, he sent the former steeds from their heroes across the stream to retain the subsidy by will or by force.

But the greater number of them consented that Tadhg O'Briain should assume the *chief* lordship over them.

In 1259 Brian O'Neill and Felim O'Conchobar held a conference at Daimh-inis [Devenish] in Loch Eirne, to deliberate upon the best means of checking the encreasing power of the English in Ireland. But in the mean time treachery was at work in Ulster: Aedh Buidhe O'Neill, the next aspirant to the chieftainship of the Cineal-Eoghain, conspired with the young O'Domhnaill to weaken the power of Brian, and they plundered Tir-Eoghain and obtained hostages from some of the Oirghialla.


In the next year Aedh O'Conchobar (Hugh O'Conor) King of Connacht, marched into Ulster with the elite of his chieftains and forces to assist Brian O'Neill to crush his English and Irish enemies, and came

to an engagement with them on the Sunday within the Octave of Ascension day. In this battle Brian O'Neill was certainly not joined by all the chieftains of Ulster for it appears from the names of the slain that he had not any forces from Ulidia or Tir-conaill, and it is also clear that the people of Fearmanach and Oirghialla, with the exception of O'h-Anluain, had deserted him. This is also quite clear from several notices in the annals, and particularly from one under the year 1261, which states, that after the battle of Dun (Down) O'Domhnaill made a predatory incursion into Tir-Eoghain, and plundered and burned the greater part of it.


The following notice of the battle of Dun-da-leath-ghlas is given in the Annals of Ulster.[364](javascript:footNote('T105009/note364.html'))


It is thus noticed in the Annals of Clonmacnoise: ‘A. D. 1260. Hugh O'Connor went to the North to assist Bryan O'Neale against the English, with a great company of Connoughtmen, where the said Bryan with the forces of Tyreowen and Hugh O'Connor with their accomplices went to give battle to the English, in which battle Bryan O'Neale, named the King of the Irish of Ireland, was killed, with these ensuing of the Irish nobility, vizt. Donnell O'Kearney; Dermott Maglaughlyn; Magnus O'Cahan; Kyan O'Hinnerge; Donnsleyve Macanna; Hugh O'Cahan; Mortagh O'Cahan; Connor O'Duffdirma and Hugh his son; Awley O'Garmley; Cowuly O'Hanlon; and fifteen of the chiefest of the family of the O'Kahans.’

p.181


‘There was also slain of Connoughtmen these ensueing persons, vizt. Cahal mac Tyernan O'Connor; Gillchrist mac Connor mac Cormaick; Donnell mac Dermoda; Moyleronie Mac Donnogh; Cahal mac Donnogh mac Mortogh; Hugh mac Murtagh Fyn; Teig mac Cahal mac Bryen mac Moyledowne; Dermott mac Teig mac Moreye mac Thomalty O'Moyleroine; Connor Mac Gilbarie; Teig mac Keyn O'Garey; Gilleberry O'Koyne, and Charles the Bushopp O'Mory's son, with many others of the noble and ignoble sort.’


‘This battle is called the battle of Downe-Dalehglass, and Bryan O'Neale is since called Bryan Catha in Dwyn (Brian catha an Dúin h-Ua Néill,) which is as much as to say in English Brian of the battle of Downe.’— (Mageoghegans Translation.)


The Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Kilronan agree with those of Clonmacnoise nearly word for word. But the old Annals of Innisfallen, preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, differ from all the Ui Neill Annalists, and positively state in brief words that Brian O'Neill was killed by his own Gaeidhil, or Irish followers.


‘A.D. 1260. Brien O'Neyll, rí Cinal Eoghin, d' á tugsat Gedhil braghdi, agus ná tug Kys na Kayn do rig Sagsan, do mharbhadh d' á Gedhelib fén, agus do ní do Gallibh, ac Dun-da-Leath-ghlas.’
  

‘A.D. 1260. Brian O'Neill, king of Cineal Eoghain, to whom the Gaeidhil had given hostages, and who had not given rent or tribute to the king of the Saxons, was killed by his own Gaeidhil and some of the foreigners at Dun-Da-Leath-ghlas.’


The notice of this battle by the Anglo- Irish Annalists are curious though brief. **Clyn** notices it as follows:
  

‘A.D. 1260. O'Neyl, regulus Ultonie occiditur cum multo populo apud civitatem de Duno, dominica infra octavas Ascensionis.’[365](javascript:footNote('T105009/note365.html'))


In Grace's Annals the death of O'Neill is incorrectly entered under the year 1259:
  

‘A.D. 1259. Stephanus de Longa Spata Justiciarius. Interfectus O'Neil ad Dunum.’[366](javascript:footNote('T105009/note366.html'))


In Dowling's Annals this battle is incorrectly entered under the year 1258, thus—
  

‘A.D. 1258. Stephanus de Longe Espee Justiciarius Hibernie 



---

p.182




Anno 42 Henrice 3, interfecit O'Nel cum 352 ejus familiaribus in vico de Down.’[367](javascript:footNote('T105009/note367.html'))


These Anglo-Irish authorities have been followed by **Dr. Hanmer** and **Sir Richard Cox**, who writes in his Hibernia Anglicana, p. 69, that ‘Stephen de Long Espee, Lord Justice, encountered O'Neale, and slew him and three hundred and fifty-two Irishmen in the streets of Down.’


From these Anglo-Irish authorities the following brief notice of the battle has been inserted in the Dublin copy of the Annals of Innisfallen, which was compiled in 1760:
  

‘A.D. 1258 *[1260]* Brian Catha-an-Duin, son of Niall Ruadh, son of Aodh O'Neill, was slain at Dun-da-leath-ghlas by the English under the command of the Lord Justice Stephen de Long Espee, and a great slaughter was made of the chiefs of Cineal-Eoghain. The transaction happened on Sunday, and his head was carried to London.’


But **Dr. Leland**, who had the translation of the old Annals of Innisfallen made in 1665 by Dudley Mac Firbisse for **Sir James Ware**, of which he had a copy in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, writes of this battle as follows:—
  

‘Ireland, in the mean time, felt all the melancholy effects of a feeble government, an aspiring nobility, laws suspended and controuled, factions engendered by pride and oppression, the anarchy of the old natives, the injustice of the new settters, local feuds, and barbarous massacres. Brian O'Nial of Tirowen, who with his principality inherited an inveterate aversion to English government, rose up in arms, compelled some neighbouring chiefs to join his standard, and spread confusion through all the North. Stephen Long Espee was called out to oppose him, and notwithstanding some advantage gained in the field, would have found it difficult to suppress this insurrection, had not the Irish prince fallen by the treachery of his own people.— (Annals of Innisfallen MS.)’ History of Ireland, vol. I. p. 230.


The poem affords us curious glimpses into the distracted state of Ireland at the period to which it refers, and into the kind of monarchical sway which the family of O'Neill claimed over all Ireland. The bard boasts of victories which Brian O'Neill and his ancestors had gained in their own province over their immediate neighbours in



---

p.183



Eastern Ulster and over the Kindred Race of Tir-Conaill. He next speaks of the *proud* circumstance, that Brian's ancestors had in their hall a chess-board formed of the bones of their hereditary enemies, the Leinstermen, which is rather a barbaric boast in 1260. The only fact referred to, worthy of an Irish prince of the house of Niall, or which could be considered national glory, is the carrying off the hostages and the tribute of the foreigners or Danes of Dublin. Not a single victory over the English is referred to, and the bard had nothing to say on that subject except that they had achieved nothing in Ulster till they slew his hero.

Among the ‘Veteres Iberni qui pro fide Catholica pugnauerunt,’ P. O'Sullevan Beare mentions ‘O'Driscol Cothliae princeps’ and ‘Cornelius O'Driscolis Magni filius.’— Hist. Cathol. Iber. tom III. lib. I. c. I.


A.D. 1585. O'h-Eidirsceoil Mor (Finghin, son of Conchobhar, son of Finghin son of Maccon,) went to Dublin to attend a Parliament there assembled that year.


This Sir Finghin, Finin, or Florence O'Driscoll, ‘tooke his landes by Letters Pattents from Queen Elizabeth, and thereby extinguished the Irish rite. The former custome was that the eldest of the familie succeeded, unto whome Mac Cartie Reagh did give a rod, and then he was reputed and obeyed as lord of the Countrie of Collimore’—MS. Brit. Mus. Harl. 1425, p. 25.


The island of Cape Cleare also belonged to them; the castle of which place, together with all their other castles, were by Sir Fineene O'Driscoll, delivered up to the Spaniards anno 1601; but were taken by the English two years [recté in a few weeks] after.—**Smith**'s Cork book, I. ch. I.


P. O'Sullevan Beare gives the following account of the conduct of the O'Driscolls at this period, in his History of the Irish Catholics:—
  

‘Zubiaur cum navibus septem, quibus munitiones, et commeatum vehebat, rursus Aquilam secutus juxta Portucastellum (Cuan an Caishlean) non procul a scopulis errans periclitabatur. Tunc temporis ilium locum possidebant, Dionysius, Dermysius, Cornelius, Thadaeus, et Darius O'Driscoles fratres, qui Zubiauri aditum ostenderunt; et Castellum tradiderunt: et cum Dermysius vir prudens, et Latinae linguae non inscius regni statum docuit. Brevi classis reginae optime instructa et militum numero superior portum ingressa Zubiaris naves non ad pugnam satis instructas, sed vectorias, navigatione vexatas, et littori applicatas, atque castellum machinamentis nudum tormentorum ictibus impune verberat, et ipsi Angli in terram descensuri videbantur. Caeterum Zubiaur a Dermysio de rebus egregie edoctus, et impendens sibi periculum praevidens aliter ac Aquila fecit; litteris missis O'Sullevani Bearrae principis auxilium nomine Catholici Regis imploraverat. O'Sullevanus, et pater meus Dermysius,

qui tunc in Beantria erant, leucas quinque Portucastello, intra horas viginti quatuor post receptas Zubiauris litteras, cum peditibus quingentis, et paucis equitibus electae juventutis illi praesto fuerunt eodem temporis momento, quo Angli in lintres exsiliebant, ut Hispanorum paucitatem terrestri proelio opprimerent. Adfuit etiam Odriscol Magnus cum Cornelio filio et aliis, Odonnobhanus et equites Maccarrhae. Quorum adventu Anglus, territus se navibus continet, et Zubiaur laetus, et confirmatus tormentis ex navibus expositis Anglicam classem biduum acerrime oppugnat. Hic igniti globi vehementissimo sulphuris impetu jacti Anglorum naves a prora ad puppim usque transfodiunt, homines et tabulas in mare propellentes Praetoria navis multis tormentis quassata praecipue conflictatur. In ea primo Zubiauris jactu homines sexaginta, qui mensis discumbebant, extinguuntur. Sequentibus etiam ictibus milites, et nautae passim cadunt. Ob id in eam ex reliquis navibus milites subsidio confluunt. Ea denique pene oppressa, et reliquae turbatae scissis funibus, anchoris relictis fugam capiunt secundo vento leviter inflante, quippe quae adverso coactae tandiu morabantur. Eo proelio succubuerunt Angli quingenti septuaginta quinque. Ex Catholicis unus interficitur Hispanus Zubiauris consanguineus, duo vulnerantur alter Hispanus, alter Ibernus. Hinc Dermysius Osullevanus pater meus Vascum Sahavedram Hispanum ducem cum ejus cohorte ducens, eisque commeatum, et jumenta suppeditans, Dumbeam etiam Bearrae principatus principem arcem et portum Osullevani jussu tradit, et menses circiter duos victum dat eodemque machinamenta, globos aeneos nitratum sulphur, plumbum, bombardicum funem, caeterasque munitiones missis Portucastellum phasellis vehi facit, ut in ilium portum, qui tutus et celeber est, Hispanis navibus aditus pateret, et eo hostiles prohiberentur. Odriscol quoque praesidium Hispanum in portum suum, et castellum ad rem gerendam opportunum intulit.’—Tom III. lib. VI. c. g.


The following is the English account of this affair published in the Pacata Hibernia, book II. c. 18.
  


‘Untill this time [of the arrival of O'Donnell to join the Spaniards] none of the Provincialls of Mounster, that had been either protected, or pardoned, relapsed; but now upon the comming of these seconds to Castlehauen, Sir Finnin O'drischall, and all the O'drischalls, Sir Owen Mac Cartie's sonnes, and almost all the Carties in Carbrie, Donnell O'sulevan Beare, O'sulevan Mores eldest son, Donnell Mac Cartie, the Earle of Clancares base sonne, with all the Carties of Desmond, John O'Connor Kerry, the Knight of Kerry, all the protected and pardoned men in Kerry and Desmond, and all else from Kinsale and Limericke westwards, joyned with O'donnell and the Spainards; whereat little wonder is to be made, considering what power Religion and Gold hath in the hearts of men; both which the Spaniards brought with them into Ireland. The supplies of Spaniards were but seuen hundred, but more were promised to follow; which mooved the wavering Irish to conceive that now the time was come for their deliverance from the English Government; whereupon they cast themselves into the Spanyards' armes, and for testimonie of their truths Donogh O'drischall delivered unto them his castle at Castlehaven, which commanded the harbour. Sir Finnin

p.388




O'drischall (*who never in the course of his whole life had been tainted with the least spot of disloyaltie*) rendred unto them his castle of Donneshed at Baltimore, and his castle at Donnelong, in the Iland of Inisherkan, betweene which castles all entrance into that haven was debarred; and Donnell O'Sullevan surrendered unto them his strong castle of Dunboy, which absolutely commaunds Beare Haven; these three harbours, beeing without all exception the best in the west of Mounster: For the guard of those places Don John assigned, that one hundred of the late supplies should remaine at Castle-haven, with a Magazine of victualls and Munition, and eight peeces of Ordnance; unto Donneshed and Donnelong hee sent one hundred foot, fiftie for each of the castles, and two peeces of Artillerie; and unto Dunboy hee also sent one hundred foot and ten great peeces: And to confirme these revolters by liberality unto his Master the King of Spain hee bestowed upon Donnell O'Sulevan two hundred foote in the King's pay, unto Donoghe Moyle Mac Cartie, sonne to Sir Owen Mac Cartie Reaghe one hundred, upon Finin Mac Cartie, his brother one hundred and twentie, and upon Phelim Mac Cartie one hundred, and to O'donevan one hundred; in all sixe hundred and twentie in the Kings entertainment; and upon others he bestowed certaine summes of money.’ &c. &c.


Again the narrative is continued in c. 19.
  


‘This night late Sir Richard Levison returned into the harbour of Kinsale, and the next day came to the Lord Deputy, unto whom hee imparted that the sixth day, with the Warrespit, the Defiance, the Swiftsure, the Marlin, one Merchant and a carvill, he arrived at Castle-haven about ten of the clock in the fornoone, before four o'clock the same day, one ship of the Enemy was suncke. The Spanish Admirall with nine foote water in hold drove to the shore upon the rocks, the Viceadmirall with two others drove likewise aground, most of the Spaniards quitting their ships; the seventh of December the wind being extreamely at south-east, hee rode still at Castle-haven, the night following, with wind at west-south-west, hee warped out with the ships, the eigth at night he returned as aforesaid.’
  


‘Since wee are informed by the Lord Coursie that they are all sunck but one ship, and great harme done both to their provisions and men.’
  

‘The Spaniards after their comeing to Castle-haven, understanding the Queene's fleet was at Kinsale, expecting their comming thither, to make themselves as strong as they could, landed five peeces of Ordnance which they planted close by the water side for the securing the harbour; but Sir Richard Levison did so ply the shipping, that he suncke and drove ashore as is related, and having effected as much as might be done by sea, was willing to have left the harbour and returne to Kinsale; but the wind being contrary, hee was not able to get forth, but was forced to ride foure and twentie houres within the play of those five peeces of Ordnance, and received in that time above three hundred shot, through hulke mast and tackle, being by no industry able to avoid it, untill some calmer weather came where by the helpe of some warpes layed forth by their boats, not without great danger and some loss (575!) he came to set sail and returned

to Kinsale. All the shot were made particularly at his ship, except some few at a Pinnace of the Queenes, wherein Captaine Flemming was commander.’ Shortly afterwards the Irish Catholics were defeated at Kinsale.


The next notice of an O'Driscoll is found in O'Sullevan Beare's History of the Irish Catholics, tom III, lib. VII. cap. 1.
  


‘Post foedus Aquilae Osullevanus in Hispaniam mittit Dermysium Odriscolem probatae fidei et prudentiae virum [filius erat Cornelii, filii Florentii, O'Driscolis Magni patruelis] celerem opem rogatum, et Danielem filium suum natu maximum paternae fidei pignus et obsidem. Quibus cum una ego quoque puer, et alii juvenes nobiles venientes a Carazenae comite Galletiae praefecto viro vetusta nobilitate claro, et in Ibernicam gentem maxime pio honorificentissime sumus excepti. Ubi ego Patricio Sinoto (Patric og Sinot) populari meo, grammatico et rhetorico polito, et limato Latinae linguae, Rotherico Vendanna Hispano ingenii acutissimi philosophiae, sed aliis aliarum doctrinarum praeceptoribus sum usus. Interim Osullevanus omni ratione, et studio conandum putavit, ut usque ad Hispani auxilii adventum se, et eos, quos Hispanorum partes sequendas moverat ab hostis impetu defenderet. Ei auxilium ferunt Daniel Maccarrha, Clancarrhae principis filius, Daniel, Osullevani Magni filius, Cornelius et Dermysius, Odriscolis Magni filii, Dermysius, Osullevanus pater meus, Dermysius, duo Dionysii, et Florentius Maccarrhas Fusci, equites Macsuinnii, Dionysius Odriscol cum suis fratribus. Ad eum confugiunt Oconchur Kierrius, Macmoris Lacsnaae Baro, eques auratus Kierrius, eques Auratus Vallis. Johannes Giraldinus comitis frater. Jaimus Buttlerus baronis Catharae frater superiore bello suis possessionibus ejecti. Osullevanus Gulielmo Burko, Richardo Tirello, et aliis conductis obaeratorum delectu conscripto, et sociorum auxiliis millia militum circiter duo juventutis electae comparat. Quibus ea hyeme Torrentirupem (Carraig an-eas-aig) arcem, quam solam in Beantria tenebat Engenius Osullevanus semper reginae partes secutus, partim aggere, turribus, vineis, musculis, pluteis oppugnatam, partim aeneis tormentis quassatam in suam potestatem redegit. Odonnobhanum ad Anglos reversum, et alios Anglorum auxiliares depraedatur. Regias copias, quae in Momoniis erant, terrore perculsas in oppida munita, et arces compellit.’ tom III, lib. VII, c. i.


‘Eisdem diebus, quibus arx Dumbea oppugnatur, Eugenius Osullevanus et Johannes Bostokus Anglus in Beam insulam [Dursey Island] navibus vehuntur, in qua erat monasterium a Bonaventura Episcopo Hispano extructum, sed a piratis dirutum, templum sancto Michaeli-Archangelo dicatum, et Castellum a patre meo Dermysio conditum, quod pauci milites Cornelii Odriscolis praesidio tenebant.’ tom III, lib. VII, c. 3.


‘Per eosdem dies, quibus Osullevanus has clades [Dunbei arcis et Beae insulae castelli excidium] recipit, Dermysius Odriscol ex Hispania reversus Osullevano tradit a Catholico Rege viginti millia nummorum aureorum in militum stipendium, litteras, quibus auxilium promittitur, et aliquas munitiones. Post vero

amissam arcem Osullevanus Cornelium Odriscolem, Odriscolis Magni filium, in Hispaniam mittit celeriorem opem efflagitatum.’ tom III, lib. VII, c. 4.


‘Of the money sent on this occasion Sir Finnin O'Driscoll and his son Connor or Cornelius received £500.’— Pacata Hibernia b. II, c. 7.


‘Cum Cerda Maculliamus in Hispaniam se confert; ubi brevi moritur. Eodem quoque tempore Cornelius Odriscol, quem in Hispaniam ab Osullevano missum fuisse docuimus, acceptis a rege Catholico duobus millibus aureorum in Momonias applicat. Ubi cum Osullevanus non esset in Hispaniam revertitur, uxorem suam et alias foeminas devehens.’ Tom III, lib. VIII. c. 3.


It appears from a letter of the Lord Deputy and Council written on the 20th of March 1601-2 to the Lords in England that Sir Finnin O'Driscoll, the O'Donovan, and the two sons of Sir Owen Mac Carthy had joined the English.
  


‘As for Sir Finnin O'drischall, O'donnevan and the two sonnes of Sir Owen Mac Cartie, they and their followers, since their coming in, are growne very odious to the Rebels of those parts, and are so well divided in factions among themselves, as they are fallen to preying and killing one another, which we conceive will much availe to the quieting of these parts.’— Pacata Hibernia b. 2, c. xxx.


Again it appears from the following passage in the Instructions given to the Earl of Thomond on the 9th of March, 1601-2, that O'Driscoll was received into favor by the English Government.
  


‘The service you are to perform is, to doe all your endeavours to burne the rebels' corne in Carbery, Beare, and Bantry, take their cowes, and to use all hostile prosecution upon the persons of the people, as in such cases of rebellion is accustomed.’
  


‘Those that are in subjection, or lately protected (as Odrischall, Odonevan, and Sir Owen Mac Cartie's sonnes,) to afford them all kind and mild usage.’ Pacata Hibernia, book 3, ch. II.


**Dr. Smith** writes, on what authority the Editor knows not, that ‘in order to ingratiate himself with Queen Elizabeth, a fleet of English ships of war were supplied, for a considerable time with fresh provisions, by this Sir Fineene O'Driscoll, who also nobly entertained all the Captains, and other officers in his castles.’ That, ‘the Queen being informed of it, pardoned his joining the Spaniards, and sent for him to court.’ But, that ‘before he arrived the Queen died.’ That ‘during his absence, great part of his possessions were intruded into by **Sir Walter Coppinger**, which caused this ancient family to fall to decay.’ Book I, ch. I.


The truth is, however, that Sir Finghin let Baltimore and the whole of **Collymore** territory to a certain Thomas Crooke for 21 years, for a fine of £2000, Sterling, and that he thus, probably, laid the foundation of a forfeiture. See **Smith**'s Cork, Book 2, ch. IV. His son Cornelius, by Ellen, daughter of **Sir Owen Mac Carthy Reagh**, was a captain in the archduke's country. His grandson, another Cornelius, an Ensign in the Spanish navy, was killed in an engagement

of the Spanish fleet with the Turks in the Mediterranean, of which P. O'Sullevan Beare gives the following account in his letter to Diarmaid O'Sullevan Beare, written in April, 1619, and published in the first Edition of his History of the Irish Catholics, but by some oversight omitted in the second Edition.
  


‘Illustrissimo Domino Dermysio O'Sullevano Dumbeae Comiti, Philippus O'Sullevanus, S.P.D.’
  


‘In Catholici Regis classem cum venissem, nihil antiquius habui, quam ut diligentissime inquirerem, quemadmodum consanguinei tui, (clarissime Dermysi) mortem oppetiverint, teque facerem certiorem. Quod ut exactius intelligatur de rebus gestis regiae classis aestate superiore pauca breviter perstringenda sunt. Anno post Virgineum partum millesimo sexcentesimo decimo octavo quinto Nonas Maii (qui dies inventae salutiferae crucis nomine in fastos relatus est) regiae naves novem Ulyssipone solvunt, Praetore Vidasavale Cantabro, Propraetore Johanne Ludovico Camarena, militum praefecto Ferdinando Luna. Dies aliquot adversis ventis usae Mediterraneum mare ingrediuntur. Ubi pridie Kalend. Junii, qui dies Petronillae Virginis morte celebratur, duae Poenorum naves bellicae Propraetorias nostrae, qua Camarena cum una Hispanorum cohorte, et Cornelius nostras Odriscol vir intrepidus cum altera Ibernorum electae juventutis ferebatur, fiunt obviae. Cum ambabus Propraetoria ab hora sexta pomeridiana usque in sequentem lucem per lucidam, atque serenam noctem tormentorum flammivomorum, atque bombardarum jactibus acriter dimicat, et minorem capit: hostibus sexaginta quinque in deditionem acceptis, et tribus proelio peremptis. Altera tormentariis ictibus labefactata, et confossa pelago obruitur. Ex nostris quatuor Hispani periere. Postero die duabus navibus simul cum Afris propugnatoribus ad Hispanam oram, et alia ad Africum littus a defensoribus deserta nostri potiuntur. Brevi naves tres ex Cantabria nostris subsidio venerunt. Ita naves Hispanse erant numero duodecim, quibus milites circiter octingenti, sub ducibus septem, et nautae quadringenti plus, minus vehebantur. Octavo Kalendas Julii (quo in honorem nati divi Johannis Baptistae festum agitur) a nostris excubitoribus naves viginti quatuor secundo vento venientes, Mediterranei pelagi fauces intrare conspiciuntur. His praeter nautas, et classiarios vehebantur duo millia, et quadringenti milites qui a Venetis erant acciti ex Anglia et Batavia contra Ferdinandum Archiducem. Eis ut aditum intercluderent, nostri erant jussi a Thoma Ibio Calderone regiae classis summo quaestore, qui tunc Gadibus erat. Neque procul in stationibus aberant Batavi senatus naves octodecim duce Muillo Lombardo, quae suis, si pugnae periclitarentur, opem laturae a nostris credebantur. Nihilominus Hispani proelium audacter ineunt. Ab hora secunda pomeridiana in noctem usque utrinque strenue et magnanime pugnatur, donec a Duce Mitinae Sidoniae misso phasello venientes aditu non prohibere nostri fuerint jussi. Eo die ex nostris sexaginta quinque, et inter eos Augustinum Ogedam et Martium Sclavum Italum cohortium duces, ex hostibus centum octodecim jacuisse traditur.’

viginti octo Saldis, vel Argelia ducens Ombrium, vel Lanzerotam unam ex Fortunatis insulis invadens, totam depraedatur, et devastat; domamque repetens Hispanis captivis, et opibus onusta classe cum ad Mediterranei maris augustias appropinquasset, naves octo duce Propraetoria praemittit. Eis praeerat Arraes Tagarinus Mauriscus magna audacia, et rei bellicae nauticaeque scientia. Quibus sexto Nonas Juiii, qui dies in memoriam Visitationis Virginis Matris festus colitur, Hispanae duodecim, et Batavae quatuordecim occurrunt. Hispana praetoria unam facile subigit. Propraetoria Hispana Turcicam Propraetoriam, quae septem comitibus praeerat, aggreditur. Erat Turcica magna tormentis multis, et centum octoginta propugnatoribus instructa. Vehemens utrinque pugna committitur tormentariis machinamentis, atque bombardis. Cum ambae cohaesissent nostri in hostilem insilire non ambigunt. Antonius Camarena Propraetoris fratris sui signifer animosus juvenis stricto gladio, scutoque laevae imposito dum ad saltum se componit, plumbea pilura confossus sternitur. Illi successit Daniel Osullevanus, frater meus, qui ducebat Ibernorum manipulum, adolescens specie pulcher, miris viribus praeditus, pugilandi scientiae peritus: quas corporis virtutes ingentis animi magnitudine superabat, insuper Latini sermonis non ignarus, neque Philosophiae et Dialecticae rudis. Superioribus dimicationibus magnam virtutem praestiterat, cum commilitones cohortando, tum per se fortissime proeliando. Sed (proh dolor!) casus infestus tulit, ut immatura morte praeventus pauciora suae fortitudinis, et magnanimitatis exempla reliquerit. Namque jam jam salturus bombardica glande pectus trajectus supra Antonium Camarenam cadit, proferens tantum illa salutifera verba *Jesus, Maria*. Paucis ante diebus Ulyssipone profecturus a peccatis expiatus sacrosanctum corpus Christi Domini sumpserat. Philippus Osullevanus patruelis meus, qui rara corporis agilitate, saltandique dexteritate praestabat, in Poenorum navim prosiluit, ita corpore librato, ut se pedibus exceperit. Ubi stricto ferro cum pluribus coepit intrepide contendere, et magna caesa vulneratus, nihilominus pugnam non remisit. Confluentibus in subsidium Christianis Mauri virtute cedunt, et simul Turcica navis ignem, vel casu, vel alicujus opera concipit. Qua flagrante Christiani et Poeni confusi et mixti partim properant in Hispanam navim se conferre, partim ingenti pavore perculsi flammae vim fugientes, in salum se praecipites dant. Philippus cum paucis, quos cohortando confirmavit, ad extinguendum ignem sese convertit. Qua spe cum decidisset corporis parte combustus antennam in mare projicit, cui innixus cum commilitonibus quindecim ad suam navim conatur adnare, sed frustra, nam undae vi rapitur. Neque ei nostri potuerunt subvenire, quia ex Turcica navi in nostram incendium fuit subito diffusum. Quo repentino malo territi alii ad poenitentiarii pedes se poplitibus excipiunt, peccatorum expiationem petentes: alii elata voce crimina sua pronunciant: aliqui se in pelagus projiciunt. Cornelius Odriscol dux, vir semper animo magno incendium reprimere nititur, alios exemplo, et cohortatione movens. Quo munere occupatus, cum ei nunciaretur, Cornelium filium signiferum periisse, ‘is,’ inquit, ‘est mihi nunc

filius, qui ad extinguendam flammam, et regiam navim liberandam opem tulerit.’ Ita potissimum fortissimi viri opera ignis extinguitur nostrae navis prora ad aquam usque pene combusta, et Christiani liberantur praeter eos, qui proeliantes ceciderunt, et paucos, qui se in mare projecerunt, Poenique centum septemdecim qui in eam sua combusta se receperunt una cum duce suo Tagarino et captivis Christianis septem, inter quos erat gravida foemina. Caeteri Christiani captivi ad numerum nonaginta, cum nostram navim nando nancisci non potuissent, cum Afris aliquot obruuntur. Ex Ibernis nobilibus praeter Danielem, Philippum et Cornellum signiferum magnae indolis juvenem consanguinitate etiam mihi conjunctum, succubuerunt hoc proelio Daniel Maccarrha, Cornelius Orrellus, Gulielmus Giraldinus, et Johannes Plunketus. Interim aliae quinque Turcicae naves non tanto discrimine capiuntur. Octava fugit, quam secutae duae Hispanae, sed non assecutae aliam Mauram obviam factam expugnant. Postero die sequuntur aliae tredecim naves ex Tabacci classe, quarum quinque Christiani in suam potestatem redegerunt. Eo toto biduo naves tredecim Afris adimuntur, ex quibus Batavi sex, Hispani reliquas ceperunt. Poeni quingenti in servitutem redacti, plures ferro, et aqua deleti: captivi circiter trecenti in libertatem asserti: Christiani centum, plus minus, desiderati.’
  


‘Haec ab hominibus fide dignis accepi, quae de rebus regiae classis te docerem. Eis liquet quam honorifice, et gloriose consanguinei tui diem suam clauserint! Quod nobis magno levamini doloris esse debet.’— Hist. Cathol. Iber. fol. 264, 266.

That this family continued to be highly respectable and important, in Ireland, not only after the Cromwellian Usurpation, but till the Revolution, is evident from various records and historical authorities. It appears from King Charles II.'s letter in favor of Col. Daniel O'Donovan that there was a Col. O'Driscoll in the royal service in Cromwell's time. This letter recites: ‘That Daniell O'Donovane of Castle O'Donovane in the County of Corke, in our kingdome of Ireland, submitted unto the peace concluded in our said kingdome in the year One Thousand Six Hundred and Forty-eight, and constantly adhered thereunto contributing his best endeavours to advance it, and suppress all oppositions that might be thereunto given, signally testifying upon all occasions his loyalty and fidelity to our service; and that he raised at his own cost and charge by Commission from the said Duke of Ormond then our Lieutenant of Ireland, two foote Companies, whereof one was commanded, as Captaine, by Morrogh O'Donovane, his brother in the regiment of Colonel Hennessy, under the command of our said Lieutenant of Ireland, at the seidge of Dublin, where the said Captaine Morogh O'Donovane was killed in our service. And that Richard O'Donovane retired himself and company into forreigne partes, and there was also killed in our service, when hee had first, as Captaine of the other foote Companie *in Colonell O'Driscoll's Regiment*, contributed his best endeavours for the furtherance
of our service, till the late *usurped* power became prevalent in our said kingdome of Ireland; and that Daniell O'Donovane persevering still constant in his loyalty to us, the said usurped power seized upon all his Estate, burning, killing, and destroying all that came in their way, and blew up with powder two of his the said Daniell's Castles.’


There is a well preserved copy of this letter in the possession of Edward Powell Esq. of Bawnlahan, in the county of Cork, and another in the Chief Remembrancer's Office, Dublin (Adventurers' Certificates Roll xviii.)


Soon after the levying of Col. Daniel O'Donovan's Regiment of infantry for the war of the Revolution was commenced, Cornelius O'Driscoll is mentioned as its intended Lieutenant Colonel. In Col. O'Donovan's papers connected with the above regiment there is a Capt. Driscoll mentioned more than once.


‘On the 2nd. of October, 1690, the Lord Marlborough came to Kinsale with the army; on the 3rd, Major General Tettau and Colonel Fitzpatrick, with about 800 men, got over in boats unperceived near Ringroan Castle, marched down towards the old fort (called Castle-ni-Park) which they boldly assaulted, and took by storm, whereupon the enemy retired into the Castle, but at the same time 3 barrells of their powder took fire at the gate and blew it up, with about 40 soldiers. At length, the Governor Colonel Driscoll and 200 of the garrison being killed, the rest surrendered upon quarter.’ Cox's Narration quoted by **Smith** in his Natural and Civil History of Cork, book 3. c. VII.


‘November 23rd, 1690, an attack was made by a Jacobite party of 500 men under the young Colonel O'Driscoll on Castletown House, near Castlehaven, the mansion house of Colonel Townshend, which they attempted to burn; but

they missed of their aim, and were so well received by Townshend and his garrison, that twelve of them dropt at the first volley, and upon a second Col. O'Driscoll, and Captain Teige Donovan, Captain Cronin, and about 30 others were slain, and so many more wounded that they were forced to retire.’ Ibid.


In French accounts of the Irish Brigades in the possession of John Cornelius O'Callaghan, Esq. Dublin, the Sieur Corneille or Cornelius O'Driscoll is spoken of as a distinguished officer in Spain in 1707 and 1708, or during the great war of the Succession, when he was Lieutenant Colonel to the Regiment of Dragoons of the famous Count Daniel O'Mahoni. In a hostile sally from Alcoy, January 2nd 1708, it is said that le Sieur Corneille Odriscol, Lieutenant Colonel du Regiment de O'Mahoni, fut blessé au pied dangereusement.


The following brief notice of the present condition of the O'Driscoll tribe is abstracted from a paper on the subject written by Rickard Donovan Esq. Clerk of the Crown for the County of Cork.
  


‘The family of O'Driscoll having fallen into decay and lost every portion of their former possessions, it is not easy now to ascertain satisfactorily who is the head of that Clan. Most of this ancient sept may now be discovered in bitter contests with the overseers of the work-houses of Skibbereen and Skull, who are more keenly anxious as to the minimum rate of food to keep alive the animal man, than the oldest and most calculating political economist of the day. From these paupers who most submissively exclaim that their present abject condition is wholly to be attributed to the will of God, no information can be obtained, except a vague tradition about Sir Fineen O'Driscoll having entertained the officers of Queen Elizabeth's fleet at his Castle at Baltimore. However, the head of the race, I believe, lately existed in the person of Mr. Michael O'Driscoll of Baltimore, who, born only to the repute of being an Irish chief, connected himself in marriage with the daughter of a namesake [of Mr. Timothy O'Driscoll and sister of the late Alexander ODriscoll esq. J.P.] by whom he got some money, by means of which he advanced himself in the world, and even became a justice of the peace, but Lord Manners swept him out of that distinction with some half dozen other Roman Catholics in the county of Cork, who had stolen into that dignity owing to some good-natured oversight in the preceding chancellor.’
  


‘This gentleman died about twenty years ago, leaving no male descendant. He had three daughters, of whom two died unmarried, and one, Eliza, was married to James O'Brien, esq, a coroner of the County of Cork, who died leaving one son Fitzjames O'Brien, who is now twenty-one years of age, and living at Castleconnell, in the county of Limerick. This Mr. Michael O'Driscoll, or 'the O'Driscoll' as he was called, had a brother, who early in life having to seek his fortune in the English Colonies, was satisfied to leave the hereditary honors to his brother, and styled himself 'William Driscoll,' thinking, no doubt, that his fortune would not be much improved by taking the O. On the death of his brother however he styled himself the O'Driscoll. He is still living [in the 84th year of his age] and has one son William Henry O'Driscoll. This

gentleman is now the head of the ancient family of the O'Driscolls, and though unconnected with the Clan, he adheres to the religion, and feelings of his ancestors.’—R. Donovan.


He claims descent from Donogh O'Driscoll who married Mary, daughter and heir at law of Gerald, 19th Baron of Kinsale, who died about the year 1642; but his pedigree has not been yet satisfactorily proved by the evidence of authentic documents. The following is furnished by Miss Mary Jane Freke of Baltimore Castle, whose mother is an O'Driscoll, and William Henry O'Driscoll of Stoke near Plymouth, the only son of the O'Driscoll.


1. FLORENCE O'DRISCOLL of Ballyisland, (son of Coll. Cornelius, son of Donogh, chief of his name.) He was born about the year 1677, and married in 1706 the daughter of O'Donovan, by whom he had two sons, 1. Denis, who succeeded him as head of the sept, and 2. William O'Driscoll, from whom the late Daniel Mac Carthy of Gortnascreena, was descended in the female line. He married, secondly, a Miss Fitzgerald, by whom he had also two sons, 1. Michael, who married Miss Honora Morris, daughter of Mr. Samuel Morris of Skibbereen, surveyor of Excise, by Sarah, eldest daughter of Colonel Daniel O'Donovan of Bawnlahan, M.P. but who died without issue; and 2. Cornelius O'Driscoll, of Florence Court and Riverview, surnamed ‘the Admiral,’ on account of his attachment to naval sports, who left one daughter, the wife of the late Dr. Power of Clonakilty, uncle to the present Dr. Power, M.P. for the County of Cork.


2. DENIS O'DRISCOLL of Creagh Court. He was born in the year 1707, and married three wives but had issue by the second only, namely, Martha O'Hea, daughter of O'Hea of Kilkern, by Mary O'Grady, daughter of the O'Grady of Kilballyowen in the County of Limerick. His children were, I. Matthias who was born in 1754: he settled in America, where he married, and had issue one son Denis, who was shot in a duel, and three daughters who are still living; II. Michael O'Driscoll of Baltimore, born in 1764, commonly called ‘THE O'DRISCOLL,’ who married Miss Helena O'Driscoll of Lakeland, daughter of Timothy O'Driscoll, Esq. J.P. and sister of Alexander O'Driscoll, Esq. J.P. and had issue Denis O'Driscoll, who died without issue, and three daughters, Helena, Eliza, and Jane, who are all dead without issue, except Eliza who married, 1. James O'Brien, Esq. Coroner of the County of Cork, by whom she had one son Michael Fitzjames O'Brien, now living; and 2ndly, De Courcy O'Grady, Esq. of Castleconnell, in the County of Limerick. III. William O'Driscoll, now the O'Driscoll, of whom presently, and IV. Cornelius O'Driscoll, who settled in America, and became an officer in the United States' Navy, in which service he died, leaving one legitimate son, William Cornelius O'Driscoll, now living at Charleston, and having legitimate issue male, who will probably become the future representatives of the family. Denis O'Driscoll had a daughter, Lucy, who married John O'Grady, Esq., of Castlefarm, in the County of Limerick.

p.399




He died in 1792, aged 85 years.


3. WILLIAM O'DRISCOLL, now THE O'DRISCOLL. He was born on the 6th of June, 1766; and he married, in August, 1802, Mary Raby, of Kingsland, in the county of Middlesex, by whom he had issue, William Henry O'Driscoll, of whom presently, and one daughter, Mary, who was born on the 6th of August, 1805, and died on the 9th of December, 1833.
  


This gentleman, during the lifetime of his brother Michael, wrote his name William Driscoll, but after his death assumed the O', and began to call himself the O'Driscoll. He entered the British navy in 1782, in which he served for some time under his relative, the Honorable Captain de Courcy, who had command of the Wizard sloop. He afterwards commanded the Devonshire, 20 guns, but left the service, and next commanded an Indiaman, in which service his son, William Henry, was actively employed for several years.
  


This O'Driscoll (William, son of Denis, son of Florence), who is now living, was in his youthful days a most magnificent specimen of the old Irish chieftain race, having been ‘mighty of limb and strong of sinews, very tall and bread in proportion; of noble countenance, and in pitch of body like a giant.’


4. WILLIAM HENRY O'DRISCOLL, Esq., of Stoke, near Plymouth. He was born on the 16th of June, 1803, and, though a fine specimen of the old Irish chieftain race, he is still unmarried. The senior line of the O'Driscolls is, therefore, likely to become extinct in the British Islands, and the genealogist of the next century will probably have to look for it in the United States of America: though, according to a wild tradition in the country, there are fishermen on Cape Clear and on other islands off the Coast of Carbery, who are lineally descended from the youngest son of Sir Finghin, or Florence, of 1602. The Rev. James O'Driscoll, P.P. of Kilmichael in the County of Cork, is said to be the great-grandson of Denis O'Driscoll of Dunbeacon Castle, who is remembered by tradition for his skill in performing on the Irish harp, who was the son of Florence O'Driscoll, called the Captain Cam, who was killed at the siege of Dunboy in 1602. Sed cum de his nihil certi scio, nihil etiam assertive determino.


Cornelius O'Driscoll, the father of Florence O'Driscoll, No. 1 supra, had a son Alexander, who married Mary O'Sullivan, daughter of Mac Fineen Duff, by Mary Mac Gillicuddy, of the Reeks, from whom descended the Mount Musick branch of the O'Driscolls, and (according to Miss Freke of Baltimore Castle) the late Alexander O'Driscoll, whose sister, Mrs. Freke, of Baltimore Castle, is still living.


‘John O'Driscoll, late Judge of the Island of Dominica was a native of the city of Cork. He inherited a small property acquired by the industry of his parents who kept a shop in Cork, and educated him well. He published in 1823 Views in Ireland, in two volumes, and in 1827 a History of Ireland in two volumes, works of considerable reputation. He died in June, 1828, whilst in his judicial appointment which he obtained through the patronage of the Marquis of Landsdowne. Mr. Windele, of Cork, lias a large collection of his papers.’

‘The late Alexander O'Driscoll, Esq., J.P., of Norton Cottage, Skibbereen, was the son of Timothy Driscoll, commonly called Tim the Guager, who was in appearance far beyond the ordinary run of men, being remarkably handsome, tall, and athletic, appearing like the son of a giant. This Timothy was, no doubt, of ancient respectable descent; but nothing seems to have been known in the country of his pedigree. He acquired considerable property as a middleman, and was a magistrate of no ordinary capacity; he was a jovial companion, had a good head, and was a kind of sense-carrier to several of his aristocratic neighbours, who had no time for anything but drinking and hunting. His son, Alexander, succeeded to a considerable property in land and tithes. This Alexander (whatever his lineage may have been and his bearing, his virtues and vices all denote that he was of no common ancestry), may be considered as the last celebrated man of the O'Driscolls in the O'Driscoll territory. He was a remarkably fine looking man; he looked, in fact, like a prince; hunted well; rode and shot well; drank well: his hospitality was boundless to all. Being in politics a high Conservative, his popularity lay with the aristocracy, who repaid him for his hospitality by giving him all those posts of honor which gentry sigh for, and which cost nothing. He was of overbearing disposition; despised all popular institutions; was severe to the peasantry, and no favorite with the Roman Catholic clergy, although a Roman Catholic himself. His end was most melancholy. In the summer assizes of 1849 he served on the county grand jury, although his embarrassments were notorious; and, instead of proceeding homewards after the duties of a grand juror were over, he remained in the city of Cork, and was arrested by a wine merchant. He applied for his discharge on the score of being on duty as a grand juror; but the application was refused, and he was confined in the city gaol. The cholera then prevailing very severely, he was seized with it, and died—a sad but not unusual reverse of fortune to befal a man who certainly gave more dinners to persons whom he did not care about than any man in her Majesty's empire. He left no issue, and his property may be said to have perished with the potatoes. A remnant of his property is in the 'Encumbered Estates' Court' for sale.’—R. Donovan.


‘Mr. Alexander O'Driscoll, of Crookhaven, is said to represent a respectable branch of this family. The heads of other respectable branches were the late Dr. O'Driscoll, of Skibbereen, whose son and nephew are still living. The late Alexander O'Driscoll, J.P. left no issue; but his sister, Mrs. Freke, of Baltimore Castle, is still living.’—J. Mac Carthy Downing.


William Justin O'Driscoll, Esq. 28, Lower Fitzwilliam-st. Dublin, is of an ancient and respectable branch of this sept, but the Editor has not been able to learn anything of his pedigree.[407](javascript:footNote('T105009/note407.html'))
