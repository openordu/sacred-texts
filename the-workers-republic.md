James Connolly.
### THE WORKERS' REPUBLIC

### INTRODUCTION


I first met James Connolly in the year 1910

on one of his visits to Belfast to engage in Socialist propaganda, soon

after his return from America. I was at that time a member of the

Independent Labour Party, which had many branches in the city of

Belfast, and was actively engaged in Socialist propaganda work. I knew

little of James Connolly and his work at this stage, as we were nurtured on the British brand of Socialist propaganda, and all the

literature we read, as well as all our speakers were imported from Great

Britain.


I had been introduced to the ‘faith’ by some of my

friends, who like myself worked in Messrs. Harland & Wolff's shipyard,

and although my mind, like most teen-agers at the time, was concentrated

on sport to the exclusion of almost every other consideration, I was

induced to take home and read Robert Blatchford's Merry

England and Britain for the British, and I was

kept judiciously supplied with pamphlets on various aspects of the

Socialist movement until I became quite interested in the subject, and

shortly afterwards did not object to the description of Socialist being

applied to myself, although at the time, in the circumstances and

particularly in the environment this was quite a momentous decision to

make. I soon became a frequent attender at Socialist meetings and found

myself taking the chair—as we described it—at street corner

meetings, and introducing the speaker to the audience, which invariably

was not large in those days if one excluded periods of stress or the

Sunday afternoon meetings at the Custom House steps, where a large crowd

was attracted by the variety of oratorical fare offered, from the

vending of quack medicine 


---

p.182


 to the robust oratory of some of

the political cum religious orators. There was at this stage a very

active Socialist movement in Great Britain, and as our school of

Socialist thought had no nationalist tradition, and was not conscious

of, and even if it had been would have been contemptuous of, a Socialist

movement in any other part of this country. We did not give any thought

to much, save the conversion of as many of our fellow workers as possible to the Socialist creed—and often marvelled at their

obtuseness in not embracing it—and regarded ourselves as being

part of a vast International Socialist movement, which one day would

emancipate the toiling masses from the thraldom of wage slavery through

the disintegration of the capitalist system of society, a fact which we

too fatalistically accepted as being inevitable in the fullness of

time.


It is quite true I had heard James Connolly and his works

discussed, and an odd copy of his magazine The Harp,

which was published during his sojourn in America, (1903-10), had fallen

into my hands. As it expressed Socialism in a different way, I was

sufficiently interested, when he appeared in person, to listen to

anything he had to say, and secure copies of his writings from the

easily read and easily assimilated Socialism Made Easy

and the Axe to the Root to his more ambitious

 Labour In Irish History, and the Reconquest of

Ireland, both of which latter books particularly opened up a

vista before me of which I was but dimly conscious.


Prior to

seeing him and meeting him, and hearing him speak, I had conjured up a

picture of him in my mind, which actual contact with him proved to be an

illusion. I had conceived of him—my imagination had undoubtedly

been coloured by the visits of some oratorical gladiators I had heard

from Great Britain—as being tall, commanding, and as the advance

notices said of him, a silver-tongued orator. I found him, however, to

be the opposite of my mental picture*;*

short, squat, unpretentious, with a distinctive even if with a slightly

raucous 


---

p.183


 brogue, which seemed to be a blend of his native

Monaghan and the city of his adoption Edinburgh. I recall that the

subject matter of his speech, and his method of delivery, were different

to what we had been used to—there were no highly imaginative

flights of flamboyant oratory. The appeal was not to the emotions, but

to the head. Calm, clear, incisive analysis of his subject,

interlarded with frequent references to Irish history, and a restrained

eloquence calculated to carry conviction. I was impressed but

disappointed, as he was somewhat less spectacular than I had expected,

but of course I was young, and my standards were false.


My mind

was, accordingly, attuned to his message a year later in 1911, when he

came North to settle in Belfast, and later became District Organiser of

the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. Meantime, I had

considered myself sufficiently conversant with Socialist philosophy and

trade unionism to mount the rostrum at the various street corner

meetings and lecture my fellow citizens on the errors of their political

and economic ways. I was also ready to embrace all of the invitations

extended to me by Connolly to assist him in addressing meetings of

dockers and mill workers whom he was organising into the Union at this

time.


His permanent advent to our City meant that we had two main

political Socialist organisations where one had mainly held sway, i.e.,

the Socialist Party of Ireland and the British organisation, the

Independent Labour Party, of which I was a member, and of which James

Keir Hardie, M.P., was one of its leading figures. Connolly's

organisation was Marxist and nationalist in outlook, while the

Independent Labour Party was reformist and pseudo-internationalist.

Obviously the latter in such an environment as Belfast was the more

popular organisation, although Connolly, being on the spot and engaging in active propaganda, was attracting a number of the more thoughtful

elements of the Socialist movement 


---

p.184


 of the City to his

standard. Perhaps it is pertinent to mention here that in the main in

those days, the members of the Socialist movement in the City were

Protestants, as the Catholics were in the main followers of the Irish

Parliamentary Party and their local parliamentary

representative—Joe Devlin, M.P., for West Belfast, who was

credited with having Labour sympathies. This was an additional handicap

to the growth of the Socialist Party of Ireland, and the obvious reason

why no attempt had been made to have the Socialist movement in Belfast

Irish based until then. This fact, however, did not prevent a few of the

leading members of the I.L.P., such as Tom Johnson and the late Davy

Campbell, and others, from being interested. Connolly was, of

course—incorrigible optimist that he was—striving

unremittingly to get the entire movement of the City to leave the

Independent Labour Party and join the Socialist Party of Ireland. This

was a much more difficult matter than Connolly, realist as he was,

appeared to apprehend. In those times it was difficult enough for one to

break with the Unionist family tradition and embrace Socialism, but much

more difficult to swallow the hook, line and sinker of Irish

Republicanism as well. A number there were who did it and paid the

inevitable price some twelve months later, during the fierce sectarian

troubles which broke out in the Belfast Shipyards when practically every

known Socialist found it impossible to continue at work, and were

subjected to physical violence, or exposed to the threat of it, as also

was every Catholic employed there, and it was a long time following

before passions became sufficiently cooled to enable either to return

with safety to their former places of employment.


Connolly's

permanent advent to Belfast synchronised with the fierce debates

proceeding in the British House of Commons on the question of Home Rule,

and the organisation of the Ulster Volunteers in the North of Ireland.

Sir Edward Carson, K.C., Bonar Law, ‘Galloper’ F. E. Smith, K.C.,

p.185


 Londonderry, Sir James Craig, and many lesser lights,

were organising the movement for the signing of the Solemn League and

Covenant to resist the granting of Home Rule by every means in their

power, and this phase of the agitation culminated a couple of years

later in the signing of this Covenant by the leaders in their own blood

on a Saturday in June, outside the City Hall, Belfast, as a symbolical

gesture of their determination to resist Home Rule, even by the shedding

of their blood. In addition, the utmost political, social and economic

pressure, was applied in home, factory and workshop to secure the

maximum number of signatures for the Covenant, and some there were who,

against their better judgment, succumbed to the pressure, and it was

only the most determined who withstood it.


This is the background

against which Connolly and a few of us kept alive and engaged in active

propaganda work, an Irish based political organisation, having as our

dual purpose the spread of Socialise ideals and the securing of Home

Rule for the country. It had been the practice during my membership of

the I.L.P. if we were interrogated at question time regarding our

attitude to Home Rule, to reply that a person could hold whatever views

he liked on that question and still be a Socialist, but I remember

Connolly advising me, as I was invariably the Chairman at all the

meetings, at this stage, that if we were asked our views on this

question that we had to be brutally blunt about the matter, and

categorically state that we favoured the granting of Home Rule to

Ireland, and that it was entirely inconsistent with the principles of

Socialism to deny such a right to Ireland, or any other country

struggling to be freed from the rule of their conquerors. We henceforth

nailed our colours to the mast, and whatever part of the City we held

forth in, there was no dissembling on this vital but highly unpopular

matter in some quarters of such a city as Belfast.


Almost

simultaneous with his taking up residence in Belfast,

p.186




Connolly, who was a frequent contributor to the Socialist press, wrote

an article in Forward (Glasgow), a weekly Socialist

journal, in the issue on the 27th May,

1911, headed A Plea for Socialist Unity in

Ireland. After mentioning that there were two Socialist

organisations in Ireland, the I.L.P. in the North and the S.P.I. in

the South, although the latter had a Branch in Belfast, and that as

organisations they had more in common than various sections within each

organisation, he proceeded to make an appeal for an effort to merge

these two organisations into one, in view of the impending political

change in the status of the country with the granting of Home Rule. He

posed the question of what kept the two organisations divided, and

proceeded: 
> 
> Laying aside all questions of personality,
> 
> personal ambitions and personal jealousies as being accidental and
> 
> unessential, it may be truthfully asserted that one point of divergence

This article of Connolly's evoked a

reply from William Walker, who was and had been the chief spokesman of

the I.L.P. in the North of Ireland for many years. Before dealing with

Walker's reply, it might be well to say a few words about the type of

man he was. A joiner by trade, at the material time he was the Trade

Union representative of the Joiners for Belfast. He was a highly

intelligent man. In appearance he would have passed for one of the

professional classes, was a brilliant and gifted speaker, was

universally popular with the citizens as well as the workers, and was

generally held in very high esteem. He had been a Poor Law Guardian, a

City Councillor, and had contested North Belfast as candidate of the

British Labour Party on several occasions, and had also, unsuccessfully,

contested an election in Leith Burgh, Scotland, as a Labour Party

candidate. In addition, he had been a member of the Executive of the

British Labour Party, and was a former President of and also a regular

Delegate to the Irish Trade Union Congress. He, however, had the disadvantage of his upbringing and environment, and while as Connolly

reminds him during this controversy he was guilty when a candidate for

North Belfast of the most egregious offences a Socialist could commit in

giving an undertaking to the Belfast Protestant 


---

p.188


 Association

that he would vote against the extension of self-government to this

country, and more heinously still that he would vote in favour of the

Protestant succession. Yet it has to be said that he was a man of great

courage, possessing a progressive mind, if one could pardon his

reactionary views concerning Ireland, and undoubtedly had fought a

strenuous fight throughout his life to make his particular brand of

Socialism a factor in the public life of Belfast and the North of

Ireland. This controversy with Connolly revealed, however, that he was

abysmally deficient in his knowledge of Irish History and the history

and philosophy of Socialism. In my judgment he proved an unworthy

opponent for Connolly on the question of Socialist polemics.


However, we better let him speak for himself. He describes Connolly's

brand of Socialism in these words— 
> 
> For if what he
> 
> preaches therein be Socialism then surely he has a monopoly of the brand
> 
> he adumbrates. I hold no brief for Belfast, but past bigotry aside, we
> 
> have moved fast towards municipal Socialism, leaving not merely the
> 
> other cities of Ireland far behind but giving the lead to many cities in
> 
> England and Scotland. We collectively own and control our gas works,
> 
> water works, harbour works, markets, tramways, electricity, museums, art
> 
> galleries, etc., whilst we municipally cater for bowlers, cricketers,
> 
> footballers, lovers of band music (having organised a Police Band), and
> 
> our ‘works’ department do an enormous amount of ‘time and
> 
> contract’ work within the municipality. With the above in operation,
> 
> we in Belfast have no need to be ashamed of being compared in municipal
> 
> management with any city in the Kingdom.
> 
> 
> 




Referring to Connolly's remark on the relationship that should exist

between the Irish and British Socialist movements, he comments:


> 
> That the S.P.I. want the Trade Unionists of Ireland to
> 
> cease to contribute dues to *[British]* amalgamated Unions.
> 
> That the co-operative movement should cease its

> 
> Socialists and Internationalists.
> 
> 
> 




Walker also

cited Scotland as a nation seeking, academically at least, legislative

independence, which in the earlier years started a Scottish Labour

Party, and continues— 
> 
> For years that Party
> 
> appealed in vain to the workers with the result that in 1909 the
> 
> Scottish societies agreed to affiliate with the British Labour Party and
> 
> their national organisations, whilst the delegates to the Portsmouth

> 
> Irish propagandists, and because of their insistence on viewing the
> 
> class war as a national question instead of as it is, a world-wide
> 
> question.
> 
> 
> 




He next quotes from the report of

the British Labour Party, Internationalism, regarding the

reception accorded to British Labour Party delegates during a visit to

Germany. They were entertained to lunch in the Reichstag building in

Berlin. One of the speakers who welcomed them was Dr. Von

Bethmann-Hollweg, afterwards Imperial Chancellor, who expressed the hope

that the German Socialist delegates would be treated in the same

hospitable way on a return visit. Walker comments: 
> 
> This is
>

In a second

article Connolly, as was to be expected, waxes sarcastic over what he

describes as ‘tawdy rhetoric, cheap and irrelevant schoolboy

history, and badly digested political philosophy, all permeated with an

artfully instilled appeal to religious prejudice and civic

sectionalism, carefully calculated to make Belfast wrap itself round in

a garment of self-righteousness, and to look with scorn upon its

supposed weaker Irish brethren.’ And continuing in

the same vein he refers to Lord Charlemont as ‘an

aristocratic poltroon who deserted and betrayed the Irish Volunteers

when they proposed to use their organisation to obtain a Democratic

extension of the suffrage and religious toleration. That he should be

cited as a Democrat proves that there is a kink somewhere, either in

Walker's conception of Democracy or in his knowledge of Irish

history.’


‘But friend Walker blunders on from absurdity to

absurdity. Remember that he is opposed to self-government to Ireland,


---

p.192




 and then admire his colossal nerve in citing the glorious

example of ‘sturdy Protestant Democrats’ who gave their whole

lives in battling, suffering and sacrifice for the cause of National

Freedom which Comrade Walker rejects. He cites Theobald Wolfe Tone.

Wolfe Tone recognised that National Independence was an essential

element to Democracy, and declared that ‘to break the connection with

England the never failing source of all our political evils’. He

cited James Fintan Lalor. Lalor declared ‘that the Irish people should

fight for full and absolute independence for this island, and for every

man within this island’. Lalor was not a Protestant, but our Comrade

also cites Lalor's contemporary, Mitchel, whom he wrongly describes as a

Presbyterian. He was instead a Unitarian. Mitchel summed up his politics

in these words ‘We must have Ireland, not for certain peers, and for

nominees of peers in College Green; but Ireland for the Irish’.’


‘Comrade Walker also cites Joseph Gillies Biggar, a sturdy and

uncomprising Home Ruler. In fact, practically all the ‘sturdy

Protestant Democrats’ he cited are men who would have treated with

contempt Walker's pitiful straddle on Irish politics. They are all men

to whom he would have been opposed were he living in their time. He

reminds us of this section by quoting among the names of Irish

‘Rebels, Grattan, Butt and Shaw’, a quotation that must have

brought a grin to the face of anyone who read it, and had even a

rudimentary knowledge of Irish history.’


‘In passing let me remark

that the names cited by Comrade Walker but confirm my point. We do not

care so much what a few men did as what the vast mass of their

co-religionists do. The vast mass of the Protestants of Ulster, except

during the period of 1798, were bitter enemies of the men he has named,

and during the bitter struggle of the Land League, when the peasantry in

the other provinces were engaged in a life and death struggle against

landlordism, the sturdy 


---

p.193


 Protestant Democracy of the North

were electing landlords, and the nominees of landlords, to every

Protestant constituency in Ulster. . .. All these men

will live in history, because they threw in their lot with the other

provinces in a common struggle for political freedom. In the exact

measure that we admire and applaud them must we condemn and deplore the

sectional and parochial action of Comrade Walker.’


To demonstrate that Walker's Socialist theories

for the movement in Ireland was not any more sound than his

Nationalistic ones, Connolly quotes an extract from a letter written by

Karl Marx to his friend Dr. L*.* Kugelmann,

on the 29th November, 1869, as follows:


> 
> I have become more and more convinced—and the only

In

a further reply Walker attempts to answer Connolly with the following:

After a long citation from a speech

delivered by the Socialist

 orator and publicist, Gabriel

Deville, in Paris in 1893, setting forth the position the Socialist

Parties of the various countries of the world should occupy in the

Socialist International movement, Connolly quotes Jean Jaurès,

whom he describes as ‘the peerless orator of the International

Socialist movementon the Nonvay and Sweden Parallel to Ireland and

England’, speaking at Limoges in 1905:

Walker, in a subsequent contribution, descended to

a personal attack on Connolly, and the Editor was constrained to state

in a footnote that unless the controversy could be raised to a level of

discussion on principles it had better cease. Despairing then of

maintaining it on that level, Connolly forebore to write further.


These quotations serve to show the wide gap that separated 


---

p.198


 the disputants in their approach to Socialist problems and

particularly to the question of International Socialism, as well as to

the claims of Ireland to the status of full nationhood. As I have

already mentioned, neither the claims of Ireland to legislative

independence nor the claims of the Socialist movement of the country

to its rightful place in the international scheme of things ever entered

the calculations of those who espoused this particular brand of

‘Northern Ireland’ Socialism, and it may not be irrelevant to

state that this tradition has continued since through all the

vicissitudes of the national struggle, until to-day we have the pitiful

spectacle of the Six Counties Labour Party recognising the territorial

status of ‘Northern Ireland’ and functioning as an open and avowed

partitionist Labour organisation.


Little more need be added by

way of comment on this controversy except to say that it is not without

significance to add, in view of the reference to the workhouse child and

the poor consumptive by William Walker that within a period of twelve

months he had accepted a position from the British Government under the

new National Insurance Acts, introduced by Lloyd George, and took his

departure from the Labour movement and the scenes of his former

activities.


He also proved an unreliable prophet during this

discussion claiming, as he did, that the I.L.P. propaganda had so

produced an atmosphere of toleration that anyone could be certain of a

fair hearing, even if he did allege that Connolly, with his

nationalistic brand of Socialism, was endeavouring to reap where he had

not sown. How false this claim was, was revealed by the fierce outbreak

of sectarian passion during the summer of 1912 already referred to, when

none but the most orthodox, politically, economically and religiously,

were permitted to work in the shipyards and leading engineering

establishments of the city, and when unoffending citizens were subjected

to excesses of brutality for no reason other than they worshipped 


---

p.199


 at a different shrine to the bigoted Tories who held sway in

the manufacturing industries or large districts of the city.


This controversy had not the effect of detaching many members of the

I.L.P. from their allegiance to it, but the following year (1912) an

attempt was made to secure the unity of the Socialist movement in

Ireland, and during the summer a conference was convened in Dublin to

consider ways and means and invitations were extended to organisations

and individuals to attend. I remember travelling from Belfast to Dublin

to attend this conference with amongst others, James Connolly, Tom

Johnson, Davy Campbell, Danny McDevitt and Joseph Mitchell. The

conference was held in the premises of the Socialist Party of Ireland in

the Antient Concert Buildings*,* Gt.

Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street) and there was a morning and

afternoon session. I did not know any of the Southern delegates

personally but, amongst them, I remember Francis Sheehy Skeffington and

Bill O'Brien being present. An incident that occurred is fresh in my

memory. The delegates from the British Socialist Party, i.e. the

organisation founded by the late Victor Grayson, M.P. , which was

operating in Belfast in a small way, had attended the morning session of

the conference but failed to attend the afternoon one. On my enquiring

the reason, I was informed they took objection to being compelled to

walk over a Union Jack that was spread on the floor over which we

crossed on our way to the conference room. This incident ended their

interest in the proposal to unify the Socialist movement in Ireland.


The main decision of the conference was to found a new organisation,

with the same principles as the Socialist Party of Ireland, but to name

it the Independent Labour Party of Ireland. A short time after our

return to Belfast, I was chosen as Chairman of the Belfast Branch of the

Party, with a room in Upper Donegall Street, for business *purposes*, while we used the room above

Danny McDevitt's tailoring premises 


---

p.200


 in Rosemary Street,

known as the ‘Bounders College’ for our propaganda meetings during

the winter. Our forum during the summer was at the lamp in Library

Street where, on occasions, we drew large crowds.


As I have

already mentioned, Home Rule for Ireland was being hotly debated, not

alone in the British Parliament but from every political platform in the

country as wide apart as from Portrush to Cork. The Unionist Party,

under the vigorous leadership of Sir Edward Carson, had organised the

Ulster Volunteer movement throughout the North of Ireland and had armed

it with rifles, which had been run into Larne and parts of the Co. Down

coast in an effort, as they stated, to prevent the extension of Home

Rule to Ireland. The Liberal Government of the day, under the

Premiership of Mr. Asquith, in an effort to avert what he regarded as

the impending civil war in Ireland had induced the leaders of the Irish

Parliamentary Party to agree to the temporary exclusion of certain

counties of Ulster from the provisions of the Home Rule Bill. John

Redmond, Joe Devlin and others had addressed their followers at a

meeting in St. Mary's Hall, Belfast, early in 1914, and had secured

their acquiescence to the Liberal Government's proposal to exclude

Ulster for a period of years.


This betrayal of the Nationalist

interests was not allowed to pass unchallenged by Connolly, who

organised a demonstration in the same hall in April, 1914, under the

auspices of the Independent Labour Party of Ireland, to protest against

the exclusion of Ulster. As Chairman of the Party in Belfast, I presided

at the meeting and, in addition to Connolly, I was supported on the

platform by Captain J. R. (‘Jack’) White, D.S.O., Thomas Johnson,

Davy Campbell and Dick Breathwith, the latter who was known as the

‘Bubbleburster’ was a convert from the Belfast Protestant

Association. This was the first big political demonstration I had

addressed indoors and the hall was packed to capacity, mainly by a Falls

Road 


---

p.201


 (Nationalist) audience. Two incidents occurred which

are still fresh in my memory. I had been handed a list, containing the

order of the speakers, by Davy Campbell and, according to this list,

Connolly was to precede Captain White. I assumed this had been done by

agreement with the speakers and soon after I had delivered myself of my

speech as Chairman, without any consultation with him, I called upon

Connolly to address the meeting, only to find there was no response from

him. He sat rivetted to his seat without even deigning to offer me an

explanation of what I regarded as his strange behaviour. I was, frankly,

non-plussed and after hesitating for a few seconds to see if he would

change his mind I turned to Captain White, who was sitting on my left on

the platform and asked him if he would speak and, on his readily

agreeing, the incident passed over. In a friendly way at the end of the

meeting I asked Connolly why he would not speak when called upon and

he replied he was not sure what Captain White was going to say and he

desired to speak after him in case he did not take the right line on the

subject. This fear, however, was groundless, as Captain White was quite

sound on the question.


The other incident was the contrast in the

reception given by this audience—an almost exclusively Nationalist

one—to the speakers. Captain White, who was an indifferent sort of

speaker in those days, had a short time prior to this been mixed up in

some trouble with the police in Dublin—an aftermath of the 1913

struggle—and came to the meeting with his head swathed in

bandages. He was given a vociferous reception by the meeting and an

attentive hearing during the course of a short, hesitant speech. In

contrast Connolly, who made an infinitely better speech, in fact one of

the best I had heard him deliver, was received with tepid lukewarmness

and had to shout above the subdued hum of conversation of the audience

to make himself heard and understood by those who desired to hear him.

The explanation of this was that Captain White 


---

p.202


 was the

scion of a Unionist family and a son of General Sir George White, of

Boer War and the defence of Ladysmith fame, had forsaken the traditional

politics of his family and had come over to the Nationalist side of

politics. Hence the warm welcome that was given to him; whereas

Connolly, during his propaganda in Belfast, was extremely critical of

the Irish Parliamentary Party and Joe Devlin, M.P., in particular, as

the local representative of the Party, and during the course of his

speech at this meeting had been strong in his denunciation of that party

for their treacherous conduct in agreeing to cut off from Ireland that

portion which had been the home of the United Irishmen, and the cradle

of the Republican movement of the country. It was at this meeting that

I first heard him quote Charles Gavan Duffy's simile of Ireland ‘as a

corpse on the dissecting table’ and, as he added, ‘amputating the

Northern portion’. The meeting was voted an overwhelming success, our

resolutions condemning the exclusion of Ulster were unanimously carried

and Connolly was quite jubilant at its close. It is, I think, worth

recording that Connolly was the only Catholic amongst the platform

speakers.


About this time the Countess Markievicz was induced by

Connolly to visit Belfast and delivered a lecture in our Hall in

Rosemary Street, entitled Revolution in the Balkan

Provinces. As usual, I presided and, as I had anticipated,

during the course of the lecture questions and discussions on this

subject were difficult to stimulate, for the main reason that few of the

small audience knew anything whatever of the subject. As was my

custom, I asked Connolly at an early stage of the discussion if he

desired to speak and he intimated that he did not. As was not unusual at

the meetings in those days, discussion was not too strictly confined to

the subject matter of the lecture and ranged over a variety of subjects,

including the big industrial dispute in Dublin of 1913, some eight

months previously. A young Dublin man, resident in Belfast, and a 


---

p.203


 party member, who had returned from a day excursion to Dublin

this Sunday evening and who had not heard a word of the lecture but

didn't consider this any handicap or a cogent enough reason why he

should not make a speech, related an incident which concerned a parish

priest, who, it was stated, had been endeavouring at Amiens Street

Station to prevent children being sent from Dublin to homes in Belfast

and England during the course of the recent Dublin strike, and the

speaker quoted a remark stated to have been made by a striker who was

looking after the embarkation of the children to the parish priest,

enquiring as to what business it was of his where the children went, as

they didn't belong to him. The latter portion of this remark, which was

capable of either an innocent or a slighting interpretation*,* was given the latter construction by

Connolly, who rose to his feet in a white heat of indignation,

passionately denouncing and literally wiping the floor with the speaker

for daring to speak so slightly and so disparagingly of a parish

priest and thundered that he considered the remark not alone irrelevant

but irreverent as well and one that should not be made at a meeting of

that kind. Some of the audience who had read Connolly's Labour,

Nationality and Religion, and regarded him as being

anti-clerical, or even unorthodox in religion, were at a loss to

understand why he should have become so indignant about a remark which

they didn't consider in good taste, but which they thought could have

been ignored, either as having been related without intended

disparagement or without consideration of its pointed implication.


Connolly was the complete propagandist and was a man with a mission

in life. His aims whilst active in Belfast could be regarded as

three-fold, the furtherance of the Irish Transport and General Workers'

Union, of which he was District Organiser, and his desire to raise the

standard of life, particularly of the dockers and the mill workers; the

development of the 


---

p.204


 Socialist movement, of which he was a

keen student and an active propagandist; and the complete reconquest of

Ireland and ultimately the establishment of a republican form of

government. He, no doubt, found the Northern environment trying and

uncongenial and it was only with difficulty he could be patient with the

odd stolid Orangeman whom he encountered in his propaganda work up to

this. One such occasion was when he was speaking at Library Street on a

Sunday evening and was expatiating on Irish history when one of this

type interrupted him, and drawing a copy of the Solemn League and

Covenant from his pocket brandished it in the air and remarked there

would be no Home Rule for Ireland and that he and his thousands of

co-signatories would see to it. Connolly, with a sardonic smile, advised

him to take the document home and frame it, adding ‘your children will

laugh at it’.


For a period after William Walker's defection

from the movement we had a joint committee, operating between ourselves

and the I.L.P., to conduct propaganda in the city. This was responsible

for producing my one difference with Connolly, as I usually found him an

extremely easy colleague to work with, although I have known him to be

rude, if not indeed intolerant, with those who differed from him on

Socialist matters.


Under this arrangement at our open-air meeting

in Library Street one Sunday evening in 1913 we had as speaker a member

of the I.L.P. He was an Englishman, residing in Belfast and was employed

in some managerial capacity. The title of his lecture is long since

forgotten by me, the subject matter of it is, however, still fresh in my

memory as being the Chairman of the meeting I have occasion to remember

it. During the course of his speech he produced a sovereign from his

waist-coat pocket and explained that, as he had always one of these to

spare, his attitude to the Socialist movement was one of benevolence as

he was not like the ordinary proletarian in a 


---

p.205


 hard-up

condition. This could have been passed over with the contempt it

deserved but then he proceeded to indulge in comments on Ireland, worthy

of an official Tory propagandist, that while the people of the North of

Ireland were thrifty and industrious the people of the South of Ireland

were slovenly and lazy, which accounted for the prosperity in the one

area, and the poverty in the other. Young as I was, I was wondering if I

shouldn't pull him down from the platform when Connolly, whom I hadn't

seen at the meeting up to this, approached me and inquired if he would

be allowed to speak after the speaker had finished, to which, in my

distraught mood, I replied in an off-hand manner that he would have the

same rights as any other member of the audience. This was the cause of

the trouble, as Connolly interpreted this as giving the right to mount

the platform and address the meeting, whereas I held that such right was

at the discretion of the Chairman which I refused him, and all others

who were clamouring to speak—some in opposition to him—and

got the meeting closed as quickly as possible. Immediately following

this I left the city for a short course of study of economics and

industrial history at Bangor University, Wales, and thinking that a

breach had taken place between Connolly and myself I was approached by

the I.L.P. to rejoin their organisation, but on my return I continued my

association with Connolly as formerly and the incident was never again

referred to between us.


Connolly occasionally made trips to

Dublin during the week-ends, and whilst there*,* was certain to participate in some of the many

industrial or political activities which agitated the Capital city in

those days. After such a visit, during which he had made a political

speech, *a* portion of which was reported

in some of the Northern newspapers, he found a letter which had been

addressed to his assistant awaiting him on his return signed by the

dockers employed at the Liverpool boat resigning from the Irish

Transport and General Workers' Union and 


---

p.206


 giving, as their

reason, ‘owing to Mr. Connolly's political opinions and ungodly

propensities’ it left them no option but to dissociate themselves

from such a man and from such a Union. On showing me this

letter—which is now in the possession of Bill O'Brien—he

smiled faintly in appreciation of the difficulty of making speeches to

suit two such diametrically opposed view points as obtained in Belfast

and Dublin. He did not, however, on account of this ‘temper the wind

to the shorn lamb’.


We held meetings to commemorate all sorts

of events in the Socialist and Nationalist calendars. Two of which were

outstanding. The celebration of the Paris Commune (1871), which he held

was the classical example of a working class insurrection, as distinct

from the many *bourgeois* attempts

to throw off the feudal ties which were hampering the development of a

rising manufacturing class; the other was on McArts fort on the top of

the Cavehill, on the spot where Theobald Wolfe Tone and his colleagues

prior to his departure to the United States and France swore never to

desist in their efforts until the last chain with England had been

broken, ‘that never failing source of all our political evils’. The

speaker at this meeting was Ernest Blythe of Lisburn, active I

understood, in the Nationalist movement of the time and later to attain

eminence in the subsequent Nationalist struggles and become Finance

Minister in the Cosgrave Government.


We also contested Dock Ward

in the municipal elections of January, 1913, with Connolly as our

candidate on a programme of wider municipal reforms on the part of the

Belfast City Council. We had a Tory as opponent but failed to make any

impression on the electorate, polling some nine hundred votes and being

beaten by about two to one, receiving mainly a Nationalist vote,

together with a small number of Protestant Labour votes.


The

shadows of World War I began to hover over Europe. 


---

p.207


 For some

time hopes went high that if the capitalist states were forced through

inexorable economic forces to make war upon each other, the Socialist

movement of Europe which had been organising to prevent such a

catastrophe would, through the aid of the general strike, make such a

contingency an impossibility. With the collapse of the Second

International when the Social Democrat representatives in the Reichstag

voted the war credits for the war lords of Germany, and with the

assassination of Jean Jaurès, the leader of the French Socialist

movement and the death of James Keir Hardie, M.P., Europe and its

workers seemed to be reeling headlong into the shambles of war. Connolly

was bitter with those Socialists who had made common cause with their

hereditary enemies*,* the capitalists*,* and who had betrayed the international

working class movement. One listening to his speeches at this stage

would have said he was pro-German, and he probably was, though not

through any love of German capitalism, which he detested as much as

British capitalism, but he saw in this struggle the possibility of the

defeat of Great Britain, and an opportunity presented to the militant

nationalists of Ireland to take advantage of England's difficulty and

make it Ireland's opportunity. He felt this was the chance he had long

waited for; and some passages of his earlier speeches which had appeared

obscure to some of us at the time, took on a new meaning, and we were

left in no doubt as to his possible course of action if war finally

eventuated, as seemed likely.


As the war clouds gathered jingoism

became more rampant in Belfast and the difficulty of our type of

propaganda meetings increased in ratio. Indifference to our meetings

gave way to hostility and we could only continue our open-air meetings

at Library Street with very great difficulty. During this period, on a

Sunday, when Connolly was absent in Dublin, I addressed the meeting and

was subjected to interruption so continuous during the course of an

hour's speech that I only got order on 


---

p.208


 two occasions during

the meeting, when I was quoting poetry. As the tempo of opposition rose

we got a further glimpse of Connolly the man of action. War had been

declared and at a meeting in Smithfield Square he demanded the introduction by the British Government of a Homestead Act

based upon a United States of America precedent; which he had knowledge

of during his sojourn in that country. At the last meeting I ever spoke

with him I was absent at the start of the meeting so he commenced

without a Chairman and was halfway through his speech when I arrived on

the scene. The opposition was so strong that he was unable to make

himself heard above the uproar. I relieved him for a spell when he took

over again until the end of the meeting. He dismounted from the platform

and literally bored his way through the dense hostile crowd out into

Royal Avenue and proceeded on his way home to the Falls Road, followed

by the angry crowd.


It was not Connolly's wish that the meetings

should be abandoned; it was not his method nor yet his disposition to

yield to the opposition of an irate mob, but rather to meet force with

force sooner than tamely submit to a noisy and turbulent element swayed

by war hysteria. A meeting of the party, however, called to consider the

continuation or otherwise of the meetings in those fateful late August

or early September days decided to suspend the meetings until more

rational days returned with Connolly and myself—the two main

speakers—the minority in favour of continuing them. This decision

filled him with disgust, as designs were already taking shape in his

mind should the war situation continue and develop, which led unerringly

to his challenge to the might of the British Empire and his heroic fight

in the ruins of Dublin's General Post Office during Easter Week, 1916,

and his no less valiant death before a firing party of British

soldiers.


The story of my association with Connolly in Belfast

would not be complete were I to omit from it a few names of those 


---

p.209


 who while not figuring prominently or at all in the matters

referred to herein were at the same time coadjutors of his and were

active workers with him in his many sided Labour and Nationalist

activities. There was the late Miss Winifred Carney (afterwards Mrs.

McBride) who was employed as his Secretary in the office of the Union in

Belfast and later served with him as his personal secretary in the

General Post Office, Dublin, during the insurrection of Easter Week,

1916. My friend and former colleague Cathal O'Shannon, at this period

also employed in the office of the Union in Belfast, as well as being

Northern correspondent for The Irish Worker, was

extremely active in the Language, Nationalist and Irish Volunteer

movements, and lastly Mr. and Mrs. James Grimley, indefatigable workers

in all phases of the movement, who, like myself, feel life-long

gratitude for the privilege of having worked with and enjoyed the

friendship of so great a man as James Connolly.

Let us free Ireland!
--------------------


Let us free

Ireland! Never mind such base, carnal thoughts as concern work and

wages, healthy homes, or lives unclouded by poverty.


Let us free

Ireland! The rackrenting landlord; is he not also an Irishman, and

wherefore should we hate him? Nay, let us not speak harshly of our

brother—yea, even when he raises our rent.


Let us free

Ireland! The profit-grinding capitalist, who robs us of three-fourths

of the fruits of our labour, who sucks the very marrow of our bones when

we are young, and then throws us out in the street, like a worn-out tool

when we are grown prematurely old in his service, is he not an Irishman,

and mayhap a patriot, and wherefore should we think harshly of him


Let us free Ireland! ‘The land that bred and bore us’. And the

landlord who makes us pay for permission to live upon it. Whoop it up

for liberty!


‘Let us free Ireland’, says the patriot who

won't touch Socialism. Let us all join together and cr-r-rush the

br-r-rutal Saxon. Let us all join together, says he, all classes and

creeds. And, says the town worker, after we have crushed the Saxon and

freed Ireland, what will we do? Oh, then you can go back to your slums,

same as before. Whoop it up for liberty!


And, says the

agricultural workers, after we have freed Ireland, what then? Oh, then

you can go scraping around for the landlord's rent or the money-

lenders' interest same as before. Whoop it up for liberty!


After

Ireland is free, says the patriot who won't touch Socialism, we will

protect all classes, and if you won't pay your rent you will be evicted

same as now. But the evicting 


---

p.212


 party, under command of the

sheriff, will wear green uniforms and the Harp without the Crown, and

the warrant turning you out on the roadside will be stamped with the

arms of the Irish Republic. Now, isn't that worth fighting for?


And when you cannot find employment, and, giving up the struggle of

life in despair, enter the poorhouse, the band of the nearest regiment

of the Irish army will escort you to the poorhouse door to the tune of

 St. Patrick's Day. Oh! it will be nice to live in those

days!


 With the Green Flag floating o'er us and an

ever-increasing army of unemployed workers walking about under the Green

Flag, wishing they had something to eat. Same as now! Whoop it up for

liberty!


Now, my friend, I also am Irish, but I'm a bit more

logical. The capitalist, I say, is a parasite on industry; as useless

in the present stage of our industrial development as any other parasite

in the animal or vegetable world is to the life of the animal or

vegetable upon which it feeds.


The working class is the victim of

this parasite—this human leech, and it is the duty and interest of

the working class to use every means in its power to oust this parasite

class from the position which enables it to thus prey upon the vitals of

labour.


Therefore, I say, let us organise as a class to meet our

masters and destroy their mastership; organise to drive them from their

hold upon public life through their political power; organise to wrench

from their robber clutch the land and workshops on and in which they

enslave us; organise to cleanse our social life from the stain of social

cannibalism, from the preying of man upon his fellow man.


Organise for a full, free and happy life *FOR ALL OR FOR

NONE*.

PEASANT PROPRIETORSHIP AND

SOCIALISM
-------------------------------------


We quite appreciate the fact that peasant

proprietary is somewhat of a hindrance to the spread of socialist ideas,

but an effective bulwark for capitalism it decidedly is not. Two of

the countries named as possessing a peasant proprietary, and therefore

as safe from socialism, are just the two countries in which socialism is

strongest, viz., France and Germany.


In Germany the socialist

party has the strongest voting power of any party in the state, polling

over two millions and a quarter votes, and in France, we are informed on

the authority of the clerical organ, the Gaulois, that

the socialist party was the only party which emerged from the late

general election in that country stronger and more hopeful than it

entered it. In fact, peasant proprietary is rather belated in Ireland

just now to be an effective barrier against the spread of socialist

principles. We do not need to fight peasant proprietary, we only need to

allow free scope for the development of capitalist enterprise in order

to see the system of small farming crushed out by the competition of the

great farms and scientific cultivation of America and Australia. Prices

of agricultural produce have been falling for the last twenty-five

years, are falling now, and will fall still lower in the future, and as

they fall the peasant proprietor finds his margin of profit disappearing

and himself drawing nearer to bankruptcy. Every fresh application of

science to agriculture, every cheapening of transit brought about by the

development of transatlantic commerce, everything in short which

increases the facilities of trade, tends to cheapen the price of

agricultural produce and leaves an ever-decreasing margin of profit for

the cultivator. Landlordism is fast becoming an economic impossibility

in Ireland, and peasant 


---

p.214


 proprietary itself in nowise

provides the small farmer with an outlet from the life of constant toil

and hunger which is his lot to-day.


But the principle of

socialism affords just that outlet and at the same time ministers to

both his social and political aspirations. When agriculture ceases to be

a private enterprise, when a free nation organises the production of its

own food stuffs as a public function, and intrusts the management of the

function to the agricultural population, under popular boards of their

own election, then the ‘keen individualism of the Irish peasant’

will find its expression in constant watchfulness over the common stock

and supervision of each others' labour, and will form the best security

against wastefulness, and the best incentive to honest toil. When the

land is the property of the people in the fullest sense (*all the

people* whether in town or country), then all the aids to

agriculture which science supplies, but which are impossible to the

poverty-stricken peasant, will be utilised by the national

administrators and placed at the service of the cultivators of the soil.

The same shrewd sense which has inspired the Irish farmers to appreciate

the advantages of agricultural cooperation in dairies and banks, with

only their little savings to finance the enterprise, will also lead them

to appreciate the advantages which might be derived from co-operation on

a national scale uith the entire resources of the nation to equip it.

And such co-operation applied to industry as well as land is the basic

idea of the future socialist republic.

THE IRISH LAND QUESTION
-----------------------


For

very many years we have seen the London Parliament sending forth Land

Act after Land Act, each and every one of them heralded by a declaration

that it embodied a complete cure for the land question in Ireland.

To-day the land question is as far from being settled as ever it was; at

least in appearance. The reason may escape the eye of the Home Rule or

Unionist editor, who dare not notice any point of industrial development

other than it suits the interests of his employers to bring before the

public, but it is very palpable indeed to all who seek, with unbiassed

minds, to ascertain the truth.


The successive Land Purchase

Bills, Land Courts for adjustment of rents, etc., are perhaps powerful

enough in softening the rigour of the relations between landlord and

tenant; and were this island surrounded by a wall of brass shutting out

the world from intercourse, might serve to settle for a long time the

agrarian disputes in Ireland. But as long as the produce of Irish

farmers must sell upon the market side by side with the produce of

countries better situated, better equipped and better organised for

agricultural operations, so long will the Irish produce be undersold: so

long will Irish farming fail to pay. Were the landlords to disappear

to-morrow, and their titles to land to become cxtinct, the peasant

proprietors remaining would still be involved in a hopeless struggle for

subsistence, whilst this island remains dominated by capitalistic

conditions.


Every perfection of agricultural methods or machinery

lowers prices; every fall in prices renders more unstable the position

of the farmer, whether tenant or proprietor; and every year—nay

every month—which passes sees this perfection and 


---

p.216




development of machinery going more and more rapidly on. We are left no

choice but socialism or universal bankruptcy.


Meanwhile it is

instructive to notice that the United Irish League agitators—from

Mr. William O'Brien down—have no remedy to offer which does not

smack of socialistic principles. The compulsory expropriation of the

graziers; the break up of grazing lands; the state help for agriculture; in fact, every proposal advocated proceeds upon the assumption

that ‘property’ has no rights as against the welfare of the community, and that the life and prosperity of the people is, or ought to

be, the first care of *statesmanship*. So far our United Irish League

agitators are borrowing the arguments of the socialists to suit their

own purposes; but they, with characteristic class selfishness, stop

short at the application thereof. They will not carry them beyond the

rural districts; yet we challenge Mr. William O'Brien to tell us a

single sufficient reason for refusing to apply to property in towns the

same stern principles he would advocate in the country. Property

*of all kinds* ought to be subject to the community, and if the

welfare of the community requires that ‘legal’ rights of property

shall be subordinated, or even totally set aside, it must be done.

The above quotation,

from the paper on Co-operation read by Father Thomas A.

Finlay, S.J., before the fourth general meeting of the Maynooth union,

calls for more than a passing notice, is deserving of more intelligent

criticism than our capitalist contemporaries have been able to bring

to bear upon it. For this reason we propose to place before our

readers a brief statement of our position in so far at least as it is

affected by the assertions contained in the paper quoted from above.


We readily allow that no man in Ireland within the clerical body, and

few men in Ireland outside the ranks of the adherents 


---

p.218


 of

scientific socialism, can bring to bear upon questions of political

economy, and the effect which theories of political economy have had

upon the industrial life of the people, such a wealth of knowledge as

the reverend gentleman whose paper we are now discussing. The feeble

and ineffective efforts of the Home Rule pressmen to criticise the

co-operative movement to which Father Finlay devotes so much of his

energy and ability is in itself proof enough that, however efficient our

journalistc guides may be as caterers to the palate of a reading public

ready to forgive every inconsistency of statement or colouring of

fact, if only it is seasoned with a dash of ‘patriotism’ or

‘true religion’, as helps to the intelligent discussion of an

economic question they are worse than useless.


The economic

theories held by the non-socialist parties in Ireland to-day and voiced

by their publicists on parties on press and platform, are in fact the

theories which prevailed in England more than fifty years

ago—during the agitation for the repeal of the corn laws, and for

free trade in general. Such ideas are now regarded throughout the

remainder of the world as outworn and obsolete; it is only in Ireland

they survive, and in Ireland only among men, who having failed to keep

step with the intellectual march of the world, would fain convince

themselves that the intellectual incapacity which shuts them off from

sympathy with the thought of the age is the distinguishing birthmark of

a true celt. That the criticism of such persons should be of little

effect in adding to our knowledge any important truth on an economic

subject is, of course, to be expected, and we do not propose to waste

our own or our readers' time in discussing them. But the arguments of

Father Finlay naturally carry more weight, and deserve, we repeat, a

much more serious study.


To begin with we would like to remind

the reverend lecturer that he did not place before his hearers such a

clear and definite idea of the true socialist position as he himself

possesses. In 


---

p.219


 a lecture delivered in Dublin before the

Statistical Society some few years ago, in dealing with the teachings of

Karl Marx—the ablest exponent of socialism the world has seen, and

the founder of that school of thought which embraces all the militant

socialist parties of the world—Father Finlay laid before his

hearers an exposition of the evolutionary nature of the socialist

doctrine, its historical derivation and materialistic basis, which is

not at all compatible with the crudely false conception of socialism to

be found in the foregoing quotation. Modern socialism, he showed, is not

the product of the brains of any man nor of any number of men; it is the

legitimate child of a long, drawn-out historical evolution, and its

consummation will only be finally possible when that evolutionary

process has attained to a suitable degree of development. As capitalist

society—the system of wage-labour and ‘free contract’

between master and man—was only developed according as the system

of feudalism—or serf labour under a hereditary landowning

nobility—broke down owing to the demand for new methods of

industry produced by the opening up of new markets through the discovery

of America, and the perfection of means of transit and communication, in

like manner will socialism also come when the development of capitalism

in its turn renders the burden of a capitalist class unbearable, and the

capitalist system unworkable.


Socialists point out that the

capitalist system depends upon the maintenace of an equilibrium between

the producing and consuming powers of the world; that business cannot go

on unless the goods produced can find customers; that owing to the rapid

development of machinery this equilibrium cannot be maintained; that

the productive powers of the world are continually increasing whilst the

virgin markets of the world are as continually diminishing; that every

new scientific process applied to industry, every new perfecting of

machinery, increases the productivity of labour, but as the area of the

world remains 


---

p.220


 unaltered the hope of finding new markets for

the products of labour grows ever less and less; that a time must come

when all the world will be exhausted as a market for the wares of

commerce, and yet invention and industrial perfectioning remain as

active as ever; that then capitalism—able to produce more in a

few months than would supply its customers for years—will have no

work for the workers who, constituting the vast majority as they do,

will have to choose between certain starvation and revolt for socialism.

That the same economic development which will create the necessity for

revolt will also provide the conditions required to make that revolt

successful, in so far as it will have forced out of business the

multitude of small capitalists, and replaced them by huge Companies,

Stores, and Trusts—huge aggregations of Capital under one head, a

unification of industry, requiring only the transference of the right

of ownership from the individual to the democratic community to bridge

the chasm between capitalism and socialism. That the private property

which the worker should possess in the fruits of his toil is continually confiscated to-day by the capitalist process of industry, and

that socialism by making *all*

citizens—society—joint heirs and owners of the tools of

production, will restore to the workers that private property of which

capitalism deprives them.


Here then is a statement of the aims

and principles of modern socialism. The intelligent reader will observe

that this is not a mere piece of speculative philosophy, nor yet the

product of disordered brains acted upon by hunger-weakened stomachs. On

the contrary it is primarily a scientific analysis of the past and

present structure of society—a comprehensive *summing up of

the facts of history*.


In face of this fact, which we would

most respectfully remind Father Finlay he has himself most loudly

explained ere now, what becomes of his statement at Maynooth that

socialism had ‘hopelessly broken down wherever it has been tried’.

The 


---

p.221


 statement was crudely false, mischievous, and

misleading, and Father Finlay would not risk his reputation by repeating

it before any audience of scientists in the world. That he thought it

quite safe to make such an utterance at Maynooth is an interesting

indication of the low estimate in which he held the intellectual grasp

of his hearers on the thought of their generation. Socialism has not

‘broken down wherever it has been tried’, because, being the fruit

of an historical evolution yet to be completed, *it has never heen

tried*.


If Father Finlay can tell when and where such an

industrial order as would be recognised by the socialist parties of the

world as socialism has been tried and failed then we will publicly

recant our errors. Wanting such information we, and with us an

ever-increasing band of the wage-slaves of capitalism will continue to

prepare for that revolt which shall establish the socialist

republic.

WOOD QUAY WARD, ELECTION ADDRESS DUBLIN, JANUARY, 1903 TO

THE ELECTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


FELLOW WORKERS,


Having been again asked to contest the Wood Quay Ward in the

interests of labour, I desire, in accepting this invitation, to lay

before you a few of the principles upon which I conducted the campaign

last election, and on which I shall fight this.


Our defeat of

last year, brought about as it was by a campaign of slander and bribery,

and a wholesale and systematic debauching of the more degraded portion

of the electorate, did not in the slightest degree affect the truth of

the principles for which we contested. These principles still remain the

only principles by which the working class can ever attain its

freedom.


When the workers come into the world we find that we are

outcasts in the world. The land on which we must live is the property of

a class who are the descendants of men who stole the land from our

forefathers, and we who are workers, are, whether in town or country,

compelled to pay for permission to live on the earth; the houses, shops,

factories, etc., which were built by the labour of our fathers at wages

that simply kept them alive are now owned by a class which never

contributed an ounce of sweat to their erecting, but whose members will

continue to draw rent and profit from them while the system lasts. As a

result of this the worker in order to live must sell himself into the

service of a master—he must sell to that master the liberty to

coin into profit the physical and mental energies.


A shopkeeper

in order to live must sell his goods for what he can get, but a worker

in order to live must sell a part of his life, nine, ten, or twelve

hours per day as the case may 


---

p.223


 be. The shopkeeper, if he is

lucky, may get the value of his goods, but the worker cannot get under

the capitalist system the value of his labour; he must accept whatever

wage those who are unemployed are willing to accept at his job. This is

what I call wage-slavery, because under it the worker is a slave who

sells himself for a wage with which to buy his rations, which is the

only difference between this system and negro slavery where the master

bought the rations and fed the slave himself. There is only one remedy

for this slavery of the working class, and that remedy is the socialist

republic, a system of society in which the land and all houses,

railways, factories, canals, workshops, and everything necessary for

work shall be owned and operated as common property, much as the land of

Ireland was owned by the clans of Ireland before England introduced the

capitalist system amongst us at the point of the sword. There is only

one way to attain that end, and that way is for the working class to

establish a political party of its own; a political party which shall

set itself to elect to all public bodies in Ireland working men resolved

to use all the power of those bodies for the workers and against their

oppressors, whether those oppressors be English, Scotch, or sham Irish

patriots. In claiming this we will only be following the example of our

masters. Every political party is the party of a class. The Unionists

represent the interests of the landlords and the big capitalists

generally; the United Irish League is the party of the middle class, the

agriculturists, the house jobbers, slum landlords, and drink sellers. If

an Irish landlord evicts a tenant farmer he is denounced by the Home

Rule press as an eneny to Ireland, but an Irish employer can lock out

and attempt to starve thousands of true Irishmen, as was done in the

building trade in 1896, in the tailoring trade in 1900, and in the

engineers of Inchicore in 1902; and not a member of parliament would

take up the fight for the workers, or bother himself about them. Nay,

the capitalists who thus 


---

p.224


 try to crush their workers are

highly honoured by the official parliamentary party, and some, like Mr.

P. White, are members of the United Irish League Executive. If a man

takes a farm from which a tenant has been evicted, he is rightly called

a traitor, but who ever heard or read of the capitalist Home Rule press

of this country saying a hard word about the scabs who go in on a strike

or lock-out, even when those scabs were imported, as was the case during the tailors' lock-out, the saddlers' strike, or the engineers'

lock-out? If the men who were imprisoned for threatening black-legs

during the engineers' lock-out had been engaged in a dispute over farms,

we would have been told that they were ‘patriots suffering for their

country’. But as they were only workmen fighting for their class

interests, we were told by the Home Rule newspapers that they were

‘misguided individuals’.


What is wanted then is for the

workers to organise for political action on socialist lines. And let us

take lesson by the municipal election of last year. Let us remember how

the drink-sellers of the Wood Quay Ward combined with the slum owner and

the house jobber; let us remember how Alderman Davin, Councillor McCall,

and all their fellow publicans issued free drinks to whoever would

accept, until on the day before election, and election day, the scenes

of bestiality and drunkenness around their shops were such as brought

the blush of shame to every decent man and woman who saw them. Let us

remember the threats and the bribery, how Mr. Byrne of Wood Quay told

the surrounding tenants, that if ‘Mr. Connolly was elected their rents

would be raised’; let us remember how the spirit of religion was

prostituted to the service of the drinkseller to drive the labourer back

into his degradation; how the workers were told that socialism and

freethinking were the same thing, although the free thinking government

of France was just after shooting down socialist workmen at Martinique

for taking part in a strike procession; let us remember how the paid

p.225


 canvassers of the capitalist candidate—hired

slanderers—gave a different account of Mr. Connolly to every

section of the electors. How they said to the Catholics that he was an

Orangeman, to the Protestants that he was a Fenian, to the Jews that he

was an anti-Semite, to others that he was a Jew, to the labourers that

he was a journalist on the make, and to the tradesmen and professional

classes that he was an ignorant labourer; that he was born in Belfast,

Derry, England, Scotland and Italy, according to the person the canvasser was talking to. Remember that all this carnival of corruption and

dishonesty was resorted to, simply in order to prevent labour from

electing a representative who could neither be bought, terrified nor

seduced, and you will understand how important your masters conceive to

be their hold on the public bodies in this country. You will also

understand that there can never be either clean, healthy, or honest

politics in the City of Dublin, until the power of the drink-sellers is

absolutely broken—they are positively the meanest and most

degraded section that ever attempted to rule a city.


Now, Ladies

and Gentlemen, you understand my position. This is socialist

republicanism, the politics of labour, of freedom from all tyrants,

foreign and native. If you are a worker your interests should compel you

to vote for me, if you are a decent citizen, whether worker or master,

you should vote for me; if you are an enemy of freedom, a tyrant, or the

tool of a tyrant, you will vote against me.


Believing that in

this fight I am fighting the fight of my class, invite every

self-respecting worker to join our committee and help the cause.


Yours in the name of labour, JAMES

CONNOLLY.

LABOUR

REPRESENTATION
----------------------


#### 1


The farmers of

Ireland denounced as unpatriotic everything that failed to serve their

class interest—including even the labourer's demand for a

cottage—let the working class of Ireland follow their lead and

test the sincerity of every man's patriotism by his devotion to the

interests of labour. In the eyes of the farmers no wagging of green

flags could make a landgrabber a patriot; let the workers apply the same

test and brand as enemies of Ireland all who believe in the subjection

of labour to capital—brand as traitors to his country all who

live by skinning Irish labour. For the working class of the world the

lesson is also plain. In every country socialism is foreign, is

unpatriotic, and will continue so until the working class embracing it

as their salvation make socialism the dominant political force. . .. By their aggressiveness and intolerance the

possessing classes erect the principles of their capitalist supremacy

into the dignity of national safeguards; according as the working class

infuse into its political organisation the same aggressiveness and

intolerance it will command the success it deserves, and make the

socialist the only good and loyal citizen.

political action and his opinion of the action of the trade unions in

under the Local Government

p.227


 Act of 1898. They are more

definite than his references later in his article in The

Harp of April, 1910.)*


The action taken upon the

Local Government Act by the representatives of the trade unionists of

Dublin is perhaps the most important step yet taken by the organised

workers in Ireland. . .. We do not, however, labour

under the belief that delegates so chosen will be socialists, or consciously in favour of socialist principles. On the contrary, we are

quite prepared to find each and every one of these representatives

solemnly repudiating the taint of socialism. But we do believe, and not

only believe but know that every workingman elected to the Municipal

Council of Dublin, if he be true to his class when elected, will find

that every step he takes in the Council in furtherance of the interests

of his class, must of necessity take the form of an application of

socialist principles. The direct employment of labour by the

municipality and consequent abolition of contracting, the rigid

enforcement of sanitary laws, reductions of the hours of labour,

increase of the wages of the lower grades of workers and reduction of

the absurdly high salaries of superior officials, exceptional taxation

of unlet property, in short, every measure for the betterment of the

condition of the workers which our working class representatives in the

Corporation could urge for adoption, has long since been adopted into

the palliative programme of the socialists, and is, in greater or *lesser* degree, the result of socialist

principles applied to the working of our civic life.


Moreover, in

pressing forward even the mildest of these reforms, it will be found

that the representatives of property in the Corporation will, irrespective of party, line up solidly against reform, and our friends who

imagine that they will secure the co-operation of the master class in

safeguarding the interests of labour will be sadly deceived. It is

because we realise these facts that we are unqualifiedly in favour of

this proposed action of the Dublin trade unions.

When the worker has so far advanced as to realise that his master's

interests are antagonistic to his own, that the master class use every

weapon from Parliament to prison to maintain their position against what

they consider the encroachment of their serfs, then we have no doubt

that the next step in the intellectual development of the worker will be

to consider whether it is wise to tolerate longer a class in society

which requires to be watched so constantly and guarded against so

vigilantly; whether there is indeed any useful function performed by the

capitalist and landlord class which the organised workers cannot perform

without them. Whether the ownership of property cannot be vested in

the organised community, and the conduct of industry entrusted to our

trade unions, who could surely furnish men who would organise production

and distribution in the interests of all much better than it is at

present done by a class animated solely by considerations of profit.

When the logic of events forces this question on the Dublin workers as

it surely will, we believe that they will not fail to answer it aright,

and that the answer will be well for our hopes of a socialist

republic.


We are trade unionists, but we are more than trade

unionists. The trade unionist who is only a trade unionist is to the

socialist what the believer in constitutional monarchy is to a

republican. The constitutional monarchist wishes to limit the power of

the king, but still wishes to have a king; the republican wishes to

abolish kingship and puts his trust in the people; the trade unionist

wishes to limit the power of the master but still wishes to have

masters: the socialist wishes to have done with masters and pins his

faith to the collective intelligence of a democratic community.


We, as socialist republicans, adopt in each case the more logical

course and bend our energies to the abolition of that principle of evil,

whose influence our moderate friends would seek only to minimise. A

socialist republic is the application 


---

p.229


 to agriculture and

industry; to the farm, the field, the workshop, of the democratic

principle of the republican ideal.


We repeat then, we hail with

joy this action of the Dublin trade unions, our candidates will joyfully

co-operate with them, for if they do not become lackeys of the

capitalist class, they must inevitably become allies of the Socialist

Republican.

CAPITALISM AND THE IRISH SMALL FARMERS
--------------------------------------


Internationalism is not an invention of socialists. As socialism

itself has sprung out of the combinations of modern society, and as the

international organisation of labour and the international scope of

commerce are but manifestations of these conditions, so the

internationalism of the socialist movement simply reflects the

development of society at large.


For example: Certain ignorant

people in Ireland, (politicians and such like) claim that Ireland should

have no concern with matters other than Home Rule, land reform and

taxes, and other matters adjustable within the four seas of Erin. To

such people I recommend a study of the following cutting from an

American capitalist paper.


Then let him remember that one of the

chief industries in Ireland to-day is the rearing and exportation of

cattle for the English market, and that tens of thousands of people are

dependent upon that for a livelihood.

Now, just as a lesson in

economics, figure out how far-reaching will be the effect of that deal

when it is completed. It means that there is a capitalist concern in

Chicago which has hundreds of stores or shops in Great Britain, *a*large number of stalls in Smithfield market,

London, great refrigerators and enormous cattle ranges in the Argentine

Republic, and will have a complete service of steamships plying

between Europe and America solely for its own use. It employs thousands

of workers in England, in the United States and South America; it

operates under the flags of three independent nations, a monarchy and

two republics; and in all three countries it builds up its trade by

underselling and ruining the small merchant.


Now turn to its

effect upon Ireland. I have already spoken of the tens of thousands of

people who in Ireland are dependent upon the cattle trade. This living

is menaced by the competition of the Beef Trust, and nothing within the

purview of Irish politicians can save them.


There is another

angle from which this situation can be approached. For some time in

Ireland there has been agitation against the huge grazing farms. It has

been felt—and rightly—that the land so given up to cattle

would be better occupied by human beings. That it were better to see

thriving men and women and children, and happy homes than to see sheep

and cows.


But sheep and cows paid better than men and women, and


---

p.233




 hence despite the unpopularity of the grazier he stayed and

waxed fat and prosperous, and the Irish men and women came to America,

some to spread the Catholic faith, and more to fester and rot in the

slums, to populate the brothels and the jails, or to die overworked and

miserable among strangers. As long as cattle raising pays better than

raising Christian men and women it will flourish in Ireland as

elsewhere.


Now comes along the Beef Trust with its elaborately

organised machinery of competition to bring the product of Argentine

Republic to compete with the grazing farms of Meath and Kildare, and I

make the prophecy that if this trust succeeds in its designs cattle

raising in Ireland will be unprofitable. And if it becomes unprofitable

to raise cattle for the London market then the Irish grazier and his

landlord will become convinced of the error of their ways, and the farms

will be let for tillage purposes to the people now clamouring in vain

for their possession.


Is it not calculated to provide thought,

even in a politician, that the chances of some Irish peasants getting

farms in Ireland depend upon the success of the Beef Trust in

conquering the markets of the Argentine Republic?


In like

manner the question of whether Irish peasants are paying too much or too

little for their farms under the new Land Acts does not depend upon the

quality of their lands so much as it depends upon agricultural prices,

and agricultural prices depend upon the development of transatlantic

steam service bringing the product of the mammoth farms of the United

States and South America to Europe. Every *Lusitania* which

shortens the distance between Europe and America hastens the doom of the

petty farmers of Ireland under the capitalist system. But to study those

things savours of internationalism, and internationalism, according to

the *amadán* politicians, is ‘so

un-Irish’.

 ROMAN CATHOLICISM AND

SOCIALISM
---------------------------------


This is the title of a pamphlet by Patrick

J. Cooney of Bridgeport, Conn., which we would like to see in the hands

of all our readers, and especially those who are struggling towards the

light out of the economic darkness of to-day. To Catholics who have

been repelled from socialism by the blatant and rude atheism of some of

its irresponsible advocates—and unfortunately the number of such

Catholics is legion—this book will be as refreshing as an oasis in

the desert to the tired and thirsty traveller.


The author is an

active Catholic and at the same time a militant socialist, and in his

presentation of our socialist doctrines he never wavers in his

allegiance to either. Here and there indeed his loyalty to the Church

seems to betray him into statements regarding her position which to our

mind would hardly stand the test of modern criticism and historical

research. But we confess that in that respect his attitude is a

refreshing change from that of the crudely superficial thinkers (?) and

scribblers who so commonly discredit the socialist ranks by their

dogmatisms on that subject. If we had to choose between the perfervid

Catholicity of our author and the blatant anti-Catholicism of the men

who are so fond of repelling earnest Catholics by their assertion that

the great conflict of the social revolution will be between the forces

of the Catholic Church and those of socialism, then we should prefer the

position of Comrade Cooney as containing the highest propagandist value,

as well as being, if historical precedents count for anything, the most

probable to last and stand the test of time.[3](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note003.html')) As a matter of fact the Catholic Church always

accepts the established order, even if it has warred upon those who had

striven to establish such order.




---

p.235


To use a homely

adage the Church ‘does not put all her eggs in one basket’, and

the man who imagines that in the supreme hour of the proletarian

struggle for victory the Church will definitely line up with the forces

of capitalism, and pledge her very existence as a Church upon the

hazardous chance of the capitalists winning, simply does not understand

the first thing about the policy of the Church in the social or

political revolutions of the past. Just as in Ireland the Church

denounced every Irish revolutionary movement in its day of activity,

as in 1798, 1848 and 1867, and yet allowed its priests to deliver

speeches in eulogy of the active spirits of those movements a generation

afterwards, so in the future the Church, which has its hand close upon

the pulse of human society, when it realises that the cause of

capitalism is a lost cause it will find excuse enough to allow freedom

of speech and expression to those lowly priests whose socialist declarations it will then use to cover and hide the absolute anti-socialism of

the Roman Propaganda. When that day comes the Papal Encyclical against

socialism will be conveniently forgotten by the Papal historians, and

the socialist utterances, of the von Kettelers, the McGlynns, and

McGradys will be heralded forth and the communistic utterances of the

early fathers as proofs of Catholic sympathy with progressive ideas.

Thus it has been in the past. Thus it will be, at least attempted, in

the future. We are not concerned to champion or to deny the morality of

such a cause in anticipation, we are simply attempting to read the

lessons of the past into the future. And, we modestly submit, this

forecast has infinitely more of probability in it than the dreams of

those who tell us so glibly of a coming Armageddon between the forces of

socialism and Catholicism. Such dreams are not the product of modern

socialist philosophy, they are a survival from the obsolete philosophy

of the days preceding the first French Revolution.[4](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note004.html'))


---

p.239





To the free-thinkers and rebels of those days—and the 


---

p.236


 professional free-thinkers of to-day have not advanced much

beyond that mental stage—God and the Church were nothing more than

the schemes of a designing priesthood intent on enslaving and robbing

the credulous masses. Religion was a systematised business of deception

and trickery invented and perpetuated by men thoroughly aware of its

falsehood and baseness, and consciously laying plans to maintain and

spread it for their own selfish ends. Kings and rulers of all kinds were

the creation of this crafty priesthood which used them to its own

purposes. That we are not in the slightest degree misstating the ideas

of the times we are criticising*,* any

student of the early freethought literature will readily concede. That

many otherwise excellent comrades have brought such ideas over into the

camp of socialism is also undeniable. But that they are also held by an

even greater number of enemies of socialism is truer still. And it is in

truth in the camp of the enemy such ideas belong, such doctrines are the

legitimate children of the teachings of individualism, and their first

progenitors both in England and France were also the first great

exponents of the capitalist doctrines of free trade and free

competition, free contract and free labour. Such conceptions of religion

are entirely opposed to the modern doctrine that the intellectual

conceptions of men are the product of their material conditions, and

flow in the grooves channelled out by the economic environment.


In the light of this modern conception of the conditions of

historical progress*,* religion appears

as the outcome of the efforts of mankind to interpret the workings of

the forces of nature, and to translate its phenomena into the terms of a

language which could be understood. The undeveloped mind cannot grasp an

abstract proposition. Therefore that which the cultured man of the

twentieth century would explain and understand as ‘a natural

process’, the mental vision of our forefathers 


---

p.237


 could

only see as the result of the good or ill will of some beneficent or

evil spirit—some God or Devil.


Hence we had in Ireland in

our Celtic legends a plentiful store of fairies, leprechauns and good

and evil spirits, and every thing on land or sea, on wind or water that

our fathers did not understand was readily attributed to the good or

perverse genius of some member or members of this fairy host. In their

turn the fairies were the descendants of the servants of the ‘Unknown

God’ whom the Celt of old worshipped in his Druidic Groves. Anyone

at all acquainted with the beliefs of the Irish peasant before the

advent of the National School to ‘spoil’ him of his innocence is

well aware that his Catholicity was almost inextricably mingled with a

belief in fairy lore and legend that testified that he was still in a

transition state of mentality between belief in the spirits of Druidism

and the angels of Catholicity.


He would have hotly repudiated

such an insinuation. But to the seeing eye the proofs were palpable and

undeniable, and this mental development of the Irish Celt towards a

clearer conception of the universe, this progress, for it was a

progress, from the conception of a world helplessly torn by the warring

of spirits to the conception of a world ruled by a Creator holding a

spirit world in subjection for a beneficent purpose, this development

was paralleled throughout the earth by all the advanced races in their

upward march to the conquest of truth. The point to be noted is this:

Yet it is this utterly

unhistorical idea, rejected by historical science as it is also rejected

by the record of the countless thousands of priests of all religions who

have cheerfully gone to martyrdom for their beliefs—and martyrdom

is incredible in a conscious imposter—it is this belief that is

often brought in and made to do duty as a result of socialist thought by

those who ought to know better. It is a matter for congratulation that

Irish socialists are free of such excrescences on socialist belief.[5](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note005.html'))

BALLOTS, BULLETS,

OR —
-----------------------


Not the least of the services our comrade, Victor

Berger,[6](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note006.html'))


---

p.246


 has rendered to the socialist cause must be

accounted the writing and publishing of that now famous article in which

he draws the attention of his readers to the possibility that the ballot

will yet be stricken from the hands of the socialist party, and raises

the question of the action our party must take in such an emergency.


It must be confessed, however, that the question has not been faced

at all squarely by the majority of the critics who have unburdened

themselves upon the matter. We have had much astonishment expressed, a

great deal of deprecation of the introduction of the question at the

present time, and not a little sly fun poked at our comrade. But one

would have thought that a question of such a character brought up for

discussion by a comrade noted for his moderation—a moderation by

some thought to be akin to compromise—would have induced in

socialists a desire to seriously consider the elements of fact and

probability behind and inspiring the question. What are these facts?


Briefly stated, the facts as they are known to us all are that all

over the United States the capitalist class is even now busily devising

ways and means by which the working class can be disfranchised. In

California it is being done by exacting an enormous sum for the right to

place a ticket upon the ballot; in Minnesota the same end is sought by

a new primary law; in the south by an educational (?) test to be imposed

only upon those who possess no property; in some States by imposing a

property qualification upon candidates; and all over by wholesale

counting out of socialist ballots, and wholesale counting in of

fraudulent votes. In addition to this we have 


---

p.242


 had in

Colorado and elsewhere many cases where the hired thugs of the capitalists forcibly occupied the polling booths, drove away the real voters

and themselves voted in the name of every citizen on the list.


These are a few of the facts. Now what are the probabilities? One is

that the capitalist class will not wait until we get a majority at the

ballot box, but will precipitate a fight upon some fake issue whilst the

mass of the workers are still undecided as to the claims of capitalism

and socialism.


Another is that even if the capitalist class were

law-abiding enough, or had miscalculated public opinion enough, to wait

until the socialists had got a majority at the ballot box in some

presidential election, they would then refuse to vacate their offices,

or to recognise the election, and with the Senate and the military in

their hands would calmly proceed to seat those candidates for President,

etc., who had received the highest votes from the capitalistic

electorate. As to the first of these probabilities, the issue upon which

a socialist success at the ballot box can be averted from the capitalist class is already here, and I expect at any time to see it quietly

but effectually materialise. It is this: we have often seen the

capitalist class invoke the aid of the Supreme Court in order to save it

some petty annoyance by declaring unconstitutional some so-called labour

or other legislation. Now I can conceive of no reason why this same

Supreme Court cannot be invoked to declare unconstitutional any or all

electoral victories of the socialist party. Some may consider this

far-fetched. I do not consider it nearly as far-fetched as the decision

which applied the anti-trust laws solely to trade unions,[7](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note007.html')) or used the Inter-State Commerce Acts to

prevent strikes upon railways.


I consider that if the capitalist

class appealed to the Supreme Court and interrogated it to declare

*whether a political party which aimed at overthrowing the

constitution of the United States could legally operate to that end

within the constitution of the United 


---

p.243


 States* the

answer in the negative which that Court would undoubtedly give would not

only be entirely logical, but would also be extremely likely to satisfy

every shallow thinker and fanatical ancestor-worshipper in the

country.


And if such an eventuality arose, and the ballot was, in

comrade Berger's words, stricken out of our hands, it would be too late

then to propound the query which our comrade propounds now, and ask our

friends and supporters: what are you going to do about it?


But

even while admitting, nay, urging all this on behalf of the pertinency

of our comrade's query, it does not follow that I therefore endorse or

recommend his alternative. The rifle is, of course, a useful weapon

under certain circumstances, but these circumstances are little likely

to occur. This is an age of complicated machinery in war as in industry,

and confronted with machine guns, and artillery which kill at seven

miles distance, rifles are not likely to be of much material value in

assisting in the solution of the labour question in a proletarian

manner. It would do comrade Berger good to read a little of the

conquests of his countryman, Count Zeppelin, over the domain of the air,

and thus think of the futility of opposing even an armed working class

to such a power as the airship. Americans have been so enamoured of the

achievements of the Wright brothers[8](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note008.html')) that too little attention has been paid to the

development of the balloon by Zeppelin. Yet in his hands it has evolved

into the most perfect and formidable fighting machine ever dreamt of.

The words ‘dirigible balloon’ seem scarcely applicable to his

creation. It is a balloon, and more. It is a floating ship, divided into

a large number of separate compartments, so that the piercing of one

even by a shell leaves the others intact and the machine still floating.

Nothing less than fire can menace it with immediate destruction. It

can carry seventeen tons and with that weight on board can be guided at

will, perform all sorts of figures and evolutions, 


---

p.244


 rise or

descend, travel fast or remain stationary. It has already been equipped with a quick-firing Krupp gun and shells made for its own special

use, and at the tests of the German army has proven itself capable of

keeping up a rapid and sustained fire without interfering with its

floating or manoeuvring powers. No army on earth, even of highly trained

and disciplined men, could withstand an attack from ten of those

monsters for as many minutes. It is more than probable that the

development of these machines will eventuate in an armed truce from

military conquest by the international capitalist class, the

consecration of the flying machine to the cold task of holding in check

the working class, and the making safe and profitable all sorts of

attacks upon social and political rights. In facing such a weapon in the

hands of our remorseless and unscrupulous masters the gun of comrade

Victor Berger will be as ineffective as the paper ballot in the hands of

a reformer.


Is the outlook, then, hopeless? No! We still have the

opportunity to forge a weapon capable of winning the fight for us

against political usurpation and all the military powers of earth, sea

or air. That weapon is to be forged in the furnace of the struggle in

the workshop, mine, factory or railroad, and its name is industrial

unionism.


A working class organised on the lines on which the

capitalist class has built its industrial plants to-day, regarding every

such plant as the true unit of organisation and society as a whole as

the sum total of those units, and ever patiently indoctrinated with the

idea that the mission of unionism is to take hold of the industrial

equipment of society, and erect itself into the real holding and

administrative force of the world; such a revolutionary working class

would have a power at its command greater than all the achievements of

science can put in the hands of the master class. An injunction

forbidding the workers of an industrial union to do a certain thing in

the interest of labour would be followed by every member of the union

doing that

p.245


 thing until jails became eagerly sought as

places of honour, and the fact of having been in one would be as proudly

vaunted as is now service on the field of Gettysburg; a Supreme Court

decision declaring invalid a socialist victory in a certain district

could be met by a general strike of all the workers in that district,

supported by the organisation all over the country, and by a relentless

boycott extending into the private life of all who supported the

fraudulently elected officials. Such a union would revive and apply to

the class war of the workers the methods and principles so successfully

applied by the peasants of Germany in the Vehmgericht, and by those of the Land League in the land

war in Ireland in the eighties.


And eventually, in case of a

Supreme Court decision rendering illegal the political activities of the

socialist party, or instructing the capitalist officials to refuse to

vacate their offices after a national victory by that party, the

industrially organised workers would give the usurping government a

Roland for its Oliver by refusing to recognise its officers, to

transport or feed its troops, to transmit its messages, to print its

notices, or to chronicle its doings by working in any newspaper which

upheld it. Finally, after having thus demonstrated the helplessness of

capitalist officialdom in the face of united action by the producers (by

attacking said officialdom with economic paralysis instead of rifle

bullets) the industrially organised working class could proceed to

take possession of the industries of the country after informing the

military and other coercive forces of capitalism that they could procure

the necessaries of life by surrendering themselves to the lawfully

elected government and renouncing the usurpers at Washington. Otherwise

they would have to try and feed and maintain themselves. In the face of

such organisation the airships would be as helpless as pirates without a

port of call, and military power a broken reed.

the military forces before which comrade Berger's rifles would break

Ireland

during the Land League, Paris during the strike of the postmen and

telegraphers, the south of France during the strike of the wine growers,

the strike of the peasants at Parma, Italy, all were miniature

demonstrations of the effectiveness of this method of warfare, all were

so many rehearsals in part for this great drama of social revolution,

all were object lessons teaching the workers how to extract the virtue

from the guns of the political masters.[9](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note009.html'))

A NEW LABOUR POLICY
-------------------


With this issue of The Harp we begin a new edition—and a new epoch

of our existence. For the past two years this journal has been printed

and published in America as the official journal of the Irish Socialist

Federation of the United States. Many circumstances—chief among

them being the cheering news of the reorganisation of the forces of

Socialism in Ireland on a basis wide enough for all the activities of

all its adherents—have induced us to transfer the office of

publication to Dublin.


Socialism in Ireland needs a

representative in the press devoted to its cause, and unhampered by any

other affiliation. That representative we propose to be. It shall be our

aim to place our columns and our poor abilities at the service of all

the brave and unselfish men and women who are battling for social

righteousness against the forces of iniquity which control and poison

human life to-day. We shall not demand that the man or woman whose hand

or voice is raised in protest or rebellion against tyranny must be at

one with us upon the means to be taken to build the new social order;

let us but agree that the social order must be built anew to serve the

ends of righteousness, and built upon a recognition of our common

heirship and ownership, and, we believe, the incidents of the struggle

against the common enemy will, in itself, force the necessary tactics

upon the mind of all. Therefore we can wait, and we ask those socialists

who differ from us in our conception of what the tactics of the army of

revolution should be, to wait also. Let us have patience with one

another; let us remember the truth that Irishmen are ever ready to

forget, viz., that we must tolerate one another or else be compelled to

tolerate the common enemy. This does not mean that we have altered or

abandoned, 


---

p.248


 or propose to alter or abandon, our belief in

the correctness of the principles for which we stood in Ireland from

1896 onward. We still believe that those principles contain the

salvation of Ireland, socially and nationally, we still believe that the

struggle of Ireland for freedom is a part of the world-wide upward

movement of the toilers of the earth, and we still believe that the

emancipation of the working class carries within it the end of all

tyranny—national, political and social.


But we have come to

the opinion that in the struggle for freedom the theoretical clearness

of a few socialists is not as important as the aroused class instincts

and consciousness of the mass of the workers. Therefore we are willing

to work and co-operate heartily with any one who will aid us in arousing the slumbering giant of labour to a knowledge of its rights and

duties. Whilst we are as firm as ever in our belief that the only hope

for Ireland, as for the rest of the world, lies in a revolutionary

reconstruction of society, and that the working class is the only one

historically fitted for that great achievement, we are prepared to

co-operate with all who will help forward the industrial and political

organisation of labour, even should the aim they set for such

organisation be far less ambitious than our own. We invite the

co-operation of all who will work with us toward that end. The

Harp shall be a free platform from which every friend of freedom

can voice his aspirations without fear, favour or affection; this paper

will not muzzle its readers, and will not allow itself to be muzzled. We

scorn the puny weapons in the intellectual armoury of the capitalist

enemy, and we shall welcome the criticisms of our friends.


In

conclusion then, let us state the work that, in our opinion, lies before

the socialists of Ireland as the more immediately pressing, after the

inculcation of the principles of socialism. That work is the proper

organisation of the working class of Ireland as a coherent whole, under

one direction and in one 


---

p.249


 organisation. That the workers of

Ireland be organised on the industrial field not as plumbers, painters,

bricklayers, dock labourers, printers, agricultural labourers, carters,

shoemakers, etc., but that all these various unions be encouraged to

become sub-divisions of one great whole whose aim it should be to

perfect an organisation in which the interests of all should be the

interests of each—in which the right of membership should rest

not in proficiency at a craft or trade, but in the fact of being a

member of the working class. Such a welding together of all the forces

of organised labour in Ireland would make it possible to effect a

settlement of most, if not all, of the questions which to-day are the

stock-in-trade of every quack reformer and politician, as indeed they

have also been for fifty years and more. A militant organisation of the

working class of Ireland, in town and country, would have as dominant

and controlling an effect upon the fortunes of the Irish working class

as the Land League had upon the fortunes of the Irish farmer.


It

would enable labour to dictate terms to the employing class, to raise

wages and to give greater possibilities of life and happiness to all, to

shorten hours and to give the parent more time to spend in the bosom of

his family, and give the working boy and girl more time to

self-improvement and study. It would create a force which could at any

time settle the question of supporting Irish manufacture by refusing to

handle all goods whose use or sale in Ireland tended to deprive Irish

men and women of a chance to earn their living in their own country, and

it would tend to create in the Irish working class the spirit of

self-reliance which comes from grappling with problems affecting a whole

class, as distinguished from the sectional, selfish spirit which is bred

by our present system of independent trade unions.


It would do

more. The feeling of power, the consciousness of strength which would

follow upon this unification of the 


---

p.250


 forces of labour, would

develop in our working class an ambition to do and dare greater things,

to march forward to the achievement of their emancipation. The

spectacle of the whole force of organised labour in Ireland acting as a

unit in the enforcement of any demand made by any of the unions in the

organisation would make in the least thoughtful a newer, brighter, more

hopeful conception of human relations than is to be found in the ranks

of any unions which accept the capitalist idea of individualism.

Capitalism teaches the people the moral conceptions of

cannibalism—the strong devouring the weak; its theory of the world

of men and women is that of a glorified pig-trough where the biggest

swine gets the most swill. The idea of human relations which would

grow out of the working class of Ireland solidifying and concentrating

their forces for their common benefit—and their abandonment of

the idea behind the English system of trade unions which has hitherto

cramped and dwarfed their mind and powers—would make for human

brother-hood and a conception of the universe worthy of a really

civilised people.


It shall be our purpose in The

Harp to work for such a reorganisation of the forces of

organised labour in Ireland—*the organisation of all who work

for wages into one body of national dimensions and scope, under one

executive head, elected by the vote of all the unions, and directing the

power of such unions in united efforts in any needed direction*.


At present we shall do no more than suggest the idea to the trade

unionists of Ireland, reserving a fuller outline of the principles of

organisation involved until a future date. It is to be hoped that those

who are to-day loyally working for the benefit of organised labour,

under the hampering conditions of old style trade unionism, will

seriously consider the great advantages which this new style would give

to their organisations, and bring the subject of a national organisation

of labour in Ireland up for discussion in their unions. And let them

remember 


---

p.251


 that the system of organisation we suggest is that

which has enabled the Industrial Workers of the World in America (the

I.W.W.) to defeat the Steel Trust, the most powerful Trust in the

world—to defeat it in the very hour of its victory over the old

style trade unions; it has enabled the French Confederation of Labour to

win last year eighty-three per cent of its strikes; and it gave victory

to the agricultural labourers of Parma, Italy, despite all the military

power of the Government, which aided the landlords and used the military

as scabs in the harvest field.


One other question we propose to

drop here as a seed in the minds of the toilers of Ireland, to germinate

and fructify until the time comes to harvest it. It is this; We have

often heard our fellow-workers in the ranks of organised labour in

Ireland complain about City Councils, Poor Law Guardians, Rural and

Urban Councils, Catholic and Protestant Churches, Railroads, Dock and

Harbour Boards, and other public bodies, as well as private capitalists,

importing into Ireland articles which could be produced as well in

Ireland, and the production of which on Irish soil would keep at home

many thousands who are now compelled to flee to the moral abyss of

American or British cities. Now, suppose you had a national organisation

of Irish workers controlling all the building and transport trades, as

well as the others, and suppose the executive of this union were issuing

an order to its members to refuse to handle*,* transport, or work beside anyone engaged in handling or

transporting such imported articles, and suppose the toilers of Ireland

responded to such a call—as the farmers of Ireland had responded

to similar calls in the Land League days—how long do you suppose

such importation would continue?


Some socialists will accuse us

of being chauvinistic. We are not. But we believe that the toilers of

each country should control the industries of their country and they

cannot do so if these industries have their location for manufacturing

purposes 


---

p.252


 in another country. Therefore, after long and

mature deliberation upon the matter in all its aspects we affirm it as

our belief that the working class of Ireland should prevent, by united

action, the conquest of the Irish market by any capitalist or merchant

whose factories or workshops are not manned by members of their

organisation.

INDUSTRIALISM AND THE TRADE UNIONS
----------------------------------


In the second part of my book Socialism Made Easy, I

have endeavoured to establish two principles in the minds of my readers

as being vitally necessary to the upbuilding of a strong revolutionary

socialist movement. Those two principles are: First, that the working

class as a class cannot become permeated with a belief in the unity of

their class interests unless they have first been trained to a

realisation of the need of industrial unity; second, that the

revolutionary act—the act of taking over the means of production

and establishing a social order based upon the principles of the working

class (labour) cannot be achieved by a disorganised, defeated and

humiliated working class, but must be the work of that class

*after* it has attained to a commanding position on the field

of economic struggle. It has been a pleasure to me to note the progress of socialist thought towards acceptance of these principles, and

to believe that the publication of that little work helped to a not

inconsiderable degree in shaping that socialist thought and in

accelerating its progress. In the following article I wish to present

one side of the discussion which inevitably arises in our socialist

party branches upon the mooting of this question. But as a preliminary

to this presentation I would like to decry, and ask my comrades to decry

and dissociate themselves from, the somewhat acrid and intolerant manner

in which this discussion is often carried on. Believing that the

socialist party is part and parcel of the labour movement of the

United States, and that in the growth of that movement to true

revolutionary clearness and consciousness it, the socialist party, is

bound to attract to itself and become mentor and teacher of elements

most unclear and lacking in class consciousness, we should recognize

that it is as much our duty to be patient and 


---

p.254


 tolerant with

the erring brother or sister within our ranks as with the rank heathen

outside the fold. No good purpose can be served by wildly declaiming

against ‘intellectuals’, nor yet by intriguing against and

misrepresenting ‘impossibilists’. The comrades who think that the

socialist party is run by ‘compromisers’, should not jump out of

the organisation and leave the revolutionists in a still more helpless

minority; and the comrades who pride themselves upon being practical

socialist politicians should not too readily accuse those who differ

with them of being potential disrupters. Viewing the situation from the

stand-point of an industrialist I am convinced that both the

industrialist and those estimable comrades who pander to the old style

trade unions to such a marked degree as to leave themselves open to the

suspicion of coquetting with the idea of a ‘labour’ party, both, I

say, have the one belief, both have arrived at the one conclusion from

such different angles that they appear as opposing instead of aiding,

auxiliary forces. That belief which both share in common is that the

triumph of socialism is impossible without the aid of labour organised

upon the economic field. It is their common possession of this one

great principle of action which impels me to say that there is a greater

identity of purpose and faith between those two opposing (?) wings of

the socialist party than either can have with any of the intervening

schools of thought. Both realise that the socialist party must rest upon

the economic struggle and the forces of labour engaged therein, and that

the socialism which is not an outgrowth and expression of that economic

struggle is not worth a moment's serious consideration.


There,

then, we have found something upon which we agree, a ground common to

both, the first desideratum of any serious discussion. The point upon

which we disagree is: *Can the present form of American trade

unions provide the socialist movement with the economic force upon which

to rest*? Or can the American 


---

p.255


 Federation of Labour

develop towards industrialism sufficiently for our needs? It is the same

problem stated in different ways. I propose to state here my reasons for

taking the negative side in that discussion.


Let it be remembered

that we are not, as some good comrades imagine, debating whether it is

possible for a member of the American Federation of Labour to become an

industrialist, or for all its members, but we are to debate whether the

organization of the American Federation of Labour is such as to permit

of a modification of its structural formation to keep pace with the

progress of industrialist ideas amongst its members. Whether the

conversion of the membership of the American Federation of Labour to

industrialism would mean the disruption of the Federation and the

throwing of it aside as the up-to-date capitalist throws aside a

machine, be it ever so costly, when a more perfectly functioning machine

has been devised.


At this point it is necessary for the complete

understanding of our subject that we step aside for a moment to consider

the genesis and organisation of the American Federation of Labour and

the trade unions patterned after it, and this involves a glance at the

history of the labour movement in America. Perhaps of all the subjects

properly pertaining to Socialist activity this subject has been the

most neglected, the least analysed. And yet it is the most vital.

Studies of Marx and popularising (sic) of Marx, studies of science and

popularising of science, studies of religion and application of same

with socialist interpretations, all these we have without limit. But of

attempts to apply the methods of Marx and of science to an analysis of

the laws of growth and incidents of development of the organisations of

labour upon the economic field the literature of the movement is almost,

if not quite, absolutely barren. Our socialist writers seem in some

strange and, to me, incomprehensible manner to have detached themselves

from the everyday struggles of the toilers and to imagine they are 


---

p.256


 doing their whole duty as interpreters of socialist thought

when they bless the economic organisation with one corner of their mouth

and insist upon the absolute hopelessness of it with the other. They

imagine, of course, that this is the astutest diplomacy, but the net

result of it has been that the organised working class has never looked

upon the socialist party as a part of the labour movement, and the

enrolled socialist party member has never found in American socialist

literature anything that helped him in strengthening his economic

organisation or leading it to victory.


Perhaps some day there

will arise in America a socialist writer who in his writing will live up

to the spirit of the Communist Manifesto that the socialists are not

apart from the labour movement, are not a sect, but are simply that part

of the working class which pushes on all others, which most clearly

understands the line of march. Awaiting the advent of that writer permit

me to remind our readers that the Knights of Labour preceded the

American Federation of Labour, that the structural formation of the

Knights was that of a mass organisation, that they aimed to organise all

toilers into one union and made no distinction of craft, *nor of

industry*, and that they cherished revolutionary aims. When the

American Federation of Labour was organised it was organised as a dual

organisation, and although at first it professed a desire to organise

none but those then unorganised, it soon developed opposition to the

Knights and proceeded to organise wherever it could find members, and

particularly to seek after the enrolment of those who were already in

the Knights of Labour. In this it was assisted by the good will of the

master class, who naturally preferred its profession of conservatism and

identity of interest between capital and labour to the revolutionary

aims and methods of the Knights. But even this assistance on the part of

the master class would not have assured its victory were it not for the

fact that its method of organisation, *into separate 


---

p.257




crafts* recognised a certain need of the industrial development of

the time which the Knights of Labour had failed up to that moment to

appraise at its proper significance.


The Knights of Labour as I

have pointed out, organised all workers into one union, an excellent

idea for teaching the toilers their ultimate class interests, but with

the defect that it made no provision for the treating of special

immediate craft interests by men and women with the requisite technical

knowledge. The scheme was the scheme of an idealist, too large-hearted

and noble-minded himself to appreciate the hold small interests can have

upon men and women. It gave rise to jealousies. The printer grumbled at

the jurisdiction of a body comprising tailors and shoemakers over his

shop struggles, and the tailors and shoemakers fretted at the attempts

of carpenters and brick-layers to understand the technicalities of

their disputes with the bosses.


To save the Knights of Labour and

to save the American working class a pilgrimage in the desert of

reaction, it but required the advent of some practical student of

industry to propose that, instead of massing all workers together

irrespective of occupation, they should, keeping their organisation

intact and remaining bound in obedience to one supreme head, *for

administrative purposes only*, group all workers together according

to their industries, and subdivide their industries again according to

crafts. That the allied crafts should select the ruling body for the

industry to which they belonged, and that the allied industries again

should elect the ruling body for the whole organisation. This could have

been done without the slightest jar to the framework of the

organisation; it would have recognized all technical differences and

specialisation of function in actual industry; it would have kept the

organisation of labour in line with the actual progress of industrial

development; and would still have kept intact the idea of the unity of

the working class by its common bond of brotherhood, a universal 


---

p.258


 membership card, and universal obligation to recognise that an

injury to one was an injury to all.


Tentative steps in such a

direction were already being taken when the American Federation of

Labour came upon the scene. The promoters of this organisation seizing

upon this one plank in the Knights of Labour organisation, specialised

its work along that line, and, instead of hastening to save the unity of

the working class on the lines above indicated, they made the growing

realisation of the need of representation of craft differences the

entering wedge for disrupting and destroying the earlier organisation of

that class.


Each craft was organised as a distinct body having no

obligation to strike or fight beside any other craft, and making its own

contracts with the bosses heedless of what was happening between these

bosses and their fellow-labourers of another craft in the same industry,

building, shop or room. The craft was organised on a national basis, to

be governed by the vote of its members throughout the nation, and with a

membership card good only in that craft and of no use to a member who

desired to leave one craft in order to follow another. The fiction of

national unity was and is still paid homage to, as vice always pays

homage to virtue, by annual congresses in which many resolutions are

gravely debated, to be forgotten as soon as congress adjourns. But the

unifying (?) qualities of this form of organisation are best revealed by

the fact that the main function of the congress seems to be to provide

the cynical master class with the, to them, pleasing spectacle of allied

organisations fiercely fighting over questions of jurisdiction.


This policy of the American Federation of Labour coupled with the

unfortunate bomb incident of Chicago,[11](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note011.html')) for which the Knights of Labour

received much of the blame, completed the ruin of the latter

organisation and destroyed the growing unity of the working class for

the time being. The industrial 


---

p.259


 union, as typified today in

the Industrial Workers of the World, could have, as I have shown,

developed out of the Knights of Labour as logically and perfectly as

the adult develops from the child. No new organisation would have been

necessary, and hence we may conclude that the Industrial Workers of the

World is the legitimate heir of the native American labour movement, the

inheritor of its principles, and the ripened fruit of its experiences.

On the other hand the American Federation of Labour may truly be

regarded as *an* usurper on the throne of

labour, *an* usurper who occupies the

throne by virtue of having strangled its predecessor, and now, like all

usurpers, raises the cry of ‘treason’ against the rightful heir

when it seeks to win its own again. It is obvious that the sway of the

American Federation of Labour in the American labour movement is but a

brief interregnum between the passing of the old revolutionary

organisation and the ascension into power of the new.


But, I

fancy I hear some one say, granting that all that is true, may we not

condemn the methods by which the American Federation of Labour

destroyed, or helped to destroy, the Knights of Labour, and still

believe that out of the American Federation of Labour we may now build

up an industrial organisation such as we need, such as the Industrial

Workers of the World aims to be?


This we can only answer by

clearly focussing in our mind the American Federation of Labour system

of organisation in actual practice. A carpenter is at work in a city. He

has a dispute with the bosses, or all his fellow carpenters have. They

will hold meetings to discuss the question of a strike, and finding the

problem too big for them they will pass it on to the headquarters, and

the headquarters pass it on to the general membership. The general

membership, from San Francisco to Rhode Island, and from Podunk to

Kalamazoo will have a vote and say upon the question of the terms upon

which the Chicago carpenters work, and if said carpenters are called out


---

p.260




 they will expect all these widely scattered carpenters to

support them by financial and moral help. But while they are soliciting

and receiving the support of their fellow-carpenters they are

precluded from calling out in sympathy with them the painters who follow

them in their work, the plumbers whose pipes they cover up, the

steamfitters who work at their elbows, or the plasterer who precedes

them. Yet the co-operation of these workers with them in their strikes

is a thousandfold more important than the voting of strike funds which

would keep them out on strike—until the building season is over

and the winter sets in. In many cities to-day there is a Building

Trades' Council which is looked upon by many as a beginning of

industrialism within the American Federation of Labour. It is not only

the beginning but it is as far as industrialism can go within that body,

and its sole function is to secure united action in remedying petty

grievances and enforcing the observance of contracts, but it does not

take part in the really important work of determining hours or wages. It

cannot for the simple reason that each of the thirty-three unions in the

building industry are international organisations with international

officers, and necessitating international referendums before any

strikes, looking to the fixing of hours or wages, are permissible.

Hence, although all the building trades branches in a given district may

be satisfied that the time is ripe for obtaining better conditions, they

cannot act before they obtain the consent of the membership throughout

the entire country, and before that is obtained the moment for action is

passed. The bond that is supposed to unite the carpenter in New York

with the carpenter in Kokomo, Indiana, is converted into a wall of

isolation which prevents him uniting, except in the most perfunctory

fashion, with the men of other crafts who work beside him. The

industrial union and the craft union are mutually exclusive terms.

Suppose all the building trades branches of Chicago resolved to unite

industrially to form an industrial union. Every branch which 


---

p.261


 became an integral part of said union, pledged to obey its call

to action, would by so doing forfeit its charter in the craft union and

in the American Federation of Labour, and outside Chicago its members

would be considered as scabs. The Brewers' Union has been fighting for

years to obtain the right to organise *all* brewery employees.

It is hindered from doing so, not only by the rules of the American

Federation of Labour, but by the form of organisation of that body.

Breweries, for instance, employ plumbers. Now if a plumber, so

employed, would join the Brewers' Union and obey its call to strike he

would be expelled from his craft union, and if ever he lost his job in

the brewery*he* would be considered as a

scab if he went to work where union plumbers were employed. A craft

union cannot recognise the right of another association to call its members out on a strike. A machinist works to-day in a machine shop; a few

months from now he may be employed in a clothing factory attending to

the repairs of sewing machines. If the clothing industry resolves itself

into an industrial union and he joins them, as he needs must if he

believes in industrialism, he loses his membership in the International

Association of Machinists. And if ever he loses his factory job and

seeks to return to the machine shop he must either do so as a nonunion

man or pay a heavy fine if he is permitted to re-enter the International

Association of Machinists. A stationary engineer works to-day at the

construction of a new building, three months from now he is in a

shipyard, six months from now he is at the mouth of a coal mine. Three

different industries, requiring three different industrial unions.


The craft card is good to-day in all of them, but if any of them

chose to form industrial unions, and called upon him to join, he could

only do so on penalty of losing his craft card and his right to strike

benefits from his old organisation. And if he did join, his card of

membership in the one he joined would be of no value when he drifted to

any of the others. How can 


---

p.262


 the American Federation of

Labour avoid this dilemma? Industrialism requires that all the workers

in a given industry be subject to the call of the governing body, or of

the vote of the workers in that industry. But if these workers are

organised in the American Federation of Labour they must be subject

only to the call of their national or international craft body; and if

at any time they obey the call of the industry in preference to the

craft they are ordered peremptorily back to scab upon their

brothers.


If in addition to this organic difficulty, and it is

the most insuperable, we take into consideration the system of making

contracts or trade agreements on a craft basis pursued by old style

unions we will see that our unfortunate brothers in the American

Federation of Labour are tied hand and foot, handcuffed and hobbled,

to prevent their advance into industrialism. During the recent

shirt-waist makers' strike in New York when the question was mooted of a

similar strike in Philadelphia our comrade Rose Pastor Stokes, according

to our socialist press, was continually urging upon the shirt-waist

makers of Philadelphia the wisdom of striking before Christmas, and

during the busy season. No more sensible advice could have been given.

It was of the very essence of industrialist philosophy. Industrialism is

more than a method of organisation—it is a science of fighting.

It says to the worker: fight only at the time you select, never when the

boss wants a fight. Fight at the height of the busy season, and in the

slack season when the workers are in thousands upon the sidewalk*,* absolutely refuse to be drawn into battle.

Even if the boss insults and vilifies your union and refuses to

recognise it, take it lying down in the slack season but mark it up in

your little note book. And when work is again rushing and master

capitalist is pressed for orders squeeze him, and squeeze him till the

most sensitive portion of his anatomy, his pocket-book, yells with pain.

That is the industrialist idea of the present phase of the class 


---

p.263


 war as organised labour should conduct it. But, whatever may

have been the case with the shirt-waist makers, that policy so ably

enunciated by comrade Rose Pastor Stokes is utterly opposed to the whole

philosophy and practice of the American Federation of Labour. Contracts

almost always expire when there is little demand for labour. For

instance the United Mine Workers' contract with the bosses expires in

the early summer when they have before them a long hot season with a

minimum demand for coal. Hence the expiration of the contract

generally finds the coal operators spoiling for a fight, and the union

secretly dreading it. Most building trade contracts with the bosses

expire in the wincer. For example, the Brotherhood of Carpenters in New

York*;* their contract expires in January.

A nice time for a fight, in the middle of a northern winter, when all

work in their vicinity is suspended owing to the rigours of the

climate!


The foregoing will, I hope, give the reader some food

for consideration upon the problem under review. That problem is

intimately allied with the future of the socialist party in America. Our

party must become the political expression of the fight in the workshop,

and draw its inspiration therefrom. Everything which tends to strengthen

and discipline the hosts of labour tends irresistibly to swell the ranks

of the revolutionary movement, and everything which tends to divide and

disorganise the hosts of labour tends also to strengthen the forces of

capitalism. *The most dispersive and isolating force at work in the

labour movement to-day is craft unionism, the most cohesive and unifying

force, industrial unionism*. In view of that fact all objections

which my comrades make to industrial unionism on the grounds of the

supposedly, or truly anti-political, bias of many members of the

Industrial Workers of the World is quite beside the mark. That question

at the present stage of the game is purely doctrinaire. The use or

non-use of political action will not be settled by the doctrinaires who

may make it their hobby to day, 


---

p.264


 but will be settled by the

workers who use the Industrial Workers of the World in their workshop

struggles. And if at any time the conditions of a struggle in shop,

factory, railroad or mine necessitate the employment of political action

those workers so organised will use it, all theories and theorists to

the contrary notwithstanding. In their march to freedom the workers will

use every weapon they find necessary.


As the economic struggle is

the preparatory school and training ground for socialists it is our duty

to help guide along right lines the effort of the workers to choose the

correct kind of organisation to fight their battles in that conflict.

According as they choose aright or wrongly, so will the development of

class consciousness in their minds be hastened or retarded by their

everyday experience in class struggles.

LABOUR AND POLITICS IN IRELAND
------------------------------


We have not any

knowledge of any country in which the working class more readily rallies

to an appeal to its class feeling than in Ireland. Whilst the knowledge

of theoretical socialism is but meagrely distributed amongst the

workers, that feeling or knowledge which the socialists call

class-consciousness is deep-seated, wide-spread and potent in its

influence. A striking manifestation of this fact was evinced in the

action of the trade unions during the first elections under the Local

Government Act of 1898. Previous to the passing of this Act the Irish

workers had no vote in municipal elections, with the necessary result

that local municipal government was completely in the hands of the

Irish capitalist class, who kept our Irish cities pest-holes of disease

and slovenliness, and made our Irish slums a horror and a byword among

the cities of Europe. But in that year the aforementioned Act placed the

municipal suffrage upon the same basis as the parliamentary. Immediately

there sprang into existence all throughout Ireland organisations of

workers aiming at wresting the municipal government from the hands of

the capitalist class, and placing it in the hands of the working class.

Those organisations were formed under the authority of the various Trade

Councils and Land and Labour Associations, and were termed Labour

Electoral Associations. They selected the constituencies, wards, to be

fought solely according to the working class character of these wards,

and without regard to the supposed political views of the other

candidates. Loyalist and Home Ruler were equal to them; their standard

was the standard of labour and under that standard the workers

rallied.


To those of us who were privileged to be in the fight in

Ireland in those days the manner in which the Irish working 


---

p.266




class responded to the appeal made to them in 1899 was a promise and a

guarantee for the future which no subsequent happenings can ever efface

from the memory. All over the island the candidates of the working class

swept to victory—in Dublin, in Cork, in Limerick, down to the

smallest agricultural districts, practically every bona-fide labour man

showed up well in the balloting, sweeping the old political parties into

confusion. Mr. John Redmond, M.P., begged the Irish workers to show

their moderation by electing landlords to the various bodies in Ireland

in order to show those gentry that they had nothing to fear from Home

Rule. The Irish workers laughed to scorn the whining counsel of this

‘half-emancipated slave’ and stood by the men of their own class,

thus ending for ever the jobbing and grafting of the landed gentry at

the expense of the rural population. The upheaval of the Irish workers

was magnificent.


But with victory came demoralisation. We have

said that the Irish worker was thoroughly true to his own class, but

lacking in socialist knowledge. This alone offers an explanation of the

subsequent set-back to the labour cause in Ireland. The men elected all

over Ireland had been elected on an independent platform, and all during

the election most of them had steadily refused to merge their cause in

any other, and had kept their independence intact and unsullied.

*The splendid vote they received was the emphatic endorsement by

the Irish workers of this political independence of labour*. But as

soon as they were elected they forgot, or seemed not to realise, this

fact, and instead of forming a distinct and independent party of their

own in the various councils, they allied themselves to one or other of

the factions of the capitalist parties, and became labour tails of the

capitalist political kites.


As soon as the shrewd old party

politicians saw this they realised immediately that they could regain

their lost supremacy. The honest Irish working man—honest himself

and inclined 


---

p.267


 to believe in the honesty of others—was

no match for the political tricksters of the capitalist parties. When he

found himself flattered and courted, invited to dinners and private

gatherings of the Home Rule councillors, plied with drink by his

associates and asked to favour them by seconding the resolutions

affirming their position on certain debatable matters to come up in the

council next day, etc., he did not realise that his genial hosts were

destroying his independence, and digging the ground from under him.


Yet so it was. The labour party was a party only in name; it came to

signify only certain men who could be trusted to draw working class

support to the side of certain capitalist factions. Unfortunately, the

only candidate run by the Irish Socialist Republican Party in that year,

Mr. E. W. Stewart, the only candidate in the interest of labour who

really understood the political trickery of the capitalists, and the

manner in which that trickery would manifest itself, and who by his

knowledge and pugnacity might have saved the situation, was defeated by

a very small majority.


In the years immediately following that

first result of the Irish workers on the field of local government the

hopeless incapacity to uphold the principle of independent political

action in which they had been elected, had its natural result in the

overwhelming defeat of every candidate who professed to stand on a

labour platform. The Irish capitalists had learned of the real weakness

of the labour movement which had at first so terrified their guilty

consciences, and the Irish workers had become disgusted at the poor

results shown by the men they had elected. Though they were perhaps not

able to frame it in so many words the Irish workers realised that a

working man member of a capitalist party is not necessarily any better

*than* a capitalist member of the same

party, perhaps not so good; but that a working man who wishes to

safeguard the interests of his class must withdraw from all capitalist

political affiliation. 


---

p.268


*And in deciding how he should

vote in any great question should consult, not with the capitalist

members of the Corporation, but with the committee of the organisations

which secured his election*.


Now we propose to the toilers of

Ireland that it is time to make an effort to retrieve the situation, and

once more to raise the banner of a militant Irish labour movement upon

the political field. The victories once achieved can be more than

duplicated, the mistakes once made will serve as beacons of warning for

the guidance of our future activities. What were the factors at work in

1899? They were: First, a Labour Electoral Association representing an

aroused working class in hot rebellion against its social and political

outlawry, but ignorant of the real causes of its subjection; second, a

small Socialist Republican Party, not much more than two years old, but

militant, enthusiastic and with a thorough knowledge of the causes of

social and national slavery. These two factors operated

independently—the socialists at all times supporting the labour

men, the labour men not always supporting the socialists.


In the

nature of things this could not well have been otherwise at that time.

But what are the elements in the labour movement in Ireland to-day? They

are a strong socialist movement, representing some of the best

intellects in Ireland, an independent socialist feeling and education on

socialist thought in every city of industrial activity in Ireland, and a

general feeling of comradeship and sympathy between the trade unions

and the socialists.


The times are ripe for a forward move! We

suggest, then, the formation of a political party in Ireland which shall

be composed of all bodies organised upon the basis of the principle of

labour; that in order to form such a party the Trade and Labour Council

of Dublin shall be invited by the socialists to take the lead in calling

a conference of labour and socialist organisations of the capital city;

that it be set forth in such 


---

p.269


 call that the purpose is to

form a party which shall act and be distinct from all others, and

entirely guided by the interests of labour. And in order to secure and

maintain the integrity of such party we also suggest that no one should

be eligible for office in this party, or eligible to be considered as

one of its candidates for any ward or constituency, unless he or she is

a member of an affiliated labour union. When this has been perfected

in Dublin then calls should be sent to other Irish cities and towns for

the purpose of forming similar bodies; and when a sufficient number

have been formed, then a national conference should be called in order

to formulate a common programme and concerted action. The Irish trade

unions, the land and labour associations and the socialist party of

Ireland could easily find a common ground of action which would leave

each free to pursue its ordinary propaganda, to maintain its own

separate existence and to serve itself whilst serving others.


Our

own hope is to see all Irish economic organisations welded into one

great body directing the whole force of labour in Ireland upon any given

point at once. But the initiation of our political union need not wait

upon the realisation of our economic or industrial union. It can begin

now. *Who will achieve the honour of first moving in that

direction? Who will bring this dream of so many minds, this hope of so

many souls, to the concrete point of a resolution to test the feelings

of the bodies interested*? We have suggested Dublin first, but it

is only a suggestion. It is open to any man anywhere who realises that

the field of our hopes and destinies in Ireland is lying crying for the

hand of the sower to nerve himself to the task.


‘England’,

said the flamboyant orator of Irish capitalism, ‘has sown dragon's

teeth and they have sprung up armed men’. Shall we not say that as

capitalism has sown poverty, disease and oppression among our Irish race

so it will see spring up a crop of working class revolutionists armed

with a holy hatred of all its institutions.




---

p.270


If we

were asked what would be the attitude of such a party towards Sinn Fein,

Home Rule, Parliamentary Parties, etc., we would reply that the attitude

of such organisations towards the party would determine its attitude

towards them. Such a party, resting upon the working class—which

is the only class capable of embracing the whole human race—must

necessarily make of itself and its class a touchstone by which all other

bodies must be tested. It must grow to the dignity of affirming that

labour is not on trial; it is civilisation that is on trial—and

all the elements of civilisation in Ireland, as elsewhere, must stand or

fall as they are true or not to the cause of labour.

The above extract from the manifesto of Ulster

Liberal Protestants, issued on 5th December,

1910, will serve as a text for my article this week. I would

especially direct the attention of the thoughtful reader to the opening

phrase in the quotation. ‘For nearly a century the question of Home

Government has barred with triple steel every door of progress’. How

true this is*,* every one acquainted with

the inner life of Ireland—its civic and social life as

distinguished from its political partisanship—can testify. Ireland

is a land of contradictions. Just as it is true that the perfervid

orators of the United Irish League, who screech most vehemently for

national freedom are in domestic affairs in Ireland the allies and

champions of social reaction, and the enemies of intellectual freedom,

so also it is true that true blue loyalist leaders, who on every

platform assert their unquenchable enthusiasm for the cause of

Protestant liberty, are the slimiest enemies of the 


---

p.272


 social

advancement of the Protestant working class. It may be news to some of

your readers, but it is an undoubted fact that the Catholic labourers in

the Catholic districts of Ulster reap the advantage of the Acts

empowering Boards of Guardians to erect labourers' cottages to a degree

far in excess of any advantage given to the Protestant agricultural

labourers in the Protestant districts. The enemies of Home Rule and

Popery are, it appears, also enemies of low rents and sanitary cottages

for their labourers. Where his mind is not obsessed with the fear of

compromising the national demand, the Irish Catholic labourer seems to

be enough of a democrat to insist upon his social rights as against his

Catholic employer or representative; but his Protestant fellow-worker

in the north seemingly allows a blatant parade of loyalty to ‘our

Protestant institutions’ to compensate for all manner of treachery

to the cause of labour.


I have pointed out before that the

harmless Act to empower a public provision for the feeding of

necessitous school children was kept out of Ireland with the

connivance—if not directly at the desire—of the Home Rule

Party. Let me add that the Ulster beaters of the Orange drum were

equally guilty in that respect. Public meetings to demand the

application of this Act to Ireland have already been held in Dublin and

Cork. The Dublin Trades' Council has acted, a general committee

composed of representatives from the Socialist Party of Ireland, the

Daughters of Erin, and the Trades Council have held a public meeting in

the Mansion House in furtherance of this object, and induced the Lord

Mayor of the city to preside in person; and the Dublin Corporation

have unanimously passed a resolution calling for this Act for Ireland.

But Belfast and 'Derry have not moved, the Orange orators are too busy

dancing imaginary war dances on the banks of the Boyne to trouble about

the starving children of Belfast, or of the city by the Foyle.


The Corporation of Catholic Cork granted me the use of 


---

p.273




their City Hall for a public meeting for this purpose, as have also the

Urban District Council at Queenstown. But the cries of the starving

children of Ulster cannot pierce the loyal ears attuned to the

after-dinner oratorical efforts of Mr. McMordie, or the poisonous,

religious, rancorous ravings of Sir Edward Carson.


But perhaps it

will be argued that the prosperity of Belfast is so great that such an

Act would be quite unnecessary, and did not Mr. McMordie rise in his

place in the House of Commons and work in a free advertisement for

workers in the linen trade of that city, by telling of the great demand

for workers there, and of its great and abundant prosperity. I extract

from the Belfast Newsletter, a rabidly loyalist paper, of

September 8, 1910, the following short

report of a speech delivered in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, by Miss Mary

Galway, Secretary of the Mill-workers, on the conditions of sweated

outworkers in the linen industry in Belfast. It shows how the Godly

Protestant employers of Belfast sweat and rob the Godly Protestant

workers, and how zeal for the Empire is made a cloak to trick out a mad

desire to amass wealth by grinding the faces of the poor:

Since then,

in answer to his unctuous self-congratulations in Parliament, Miss

Galway has challenged Mr. M'Mordie, M.P., to take a walk with her to

houses within fifteen minutes of the Belfast City Hall, and she would

show him still more outrageous cases of sweating; but no acceptance is

yet forthcoming.


But when election time rolls around, the smug

representative of orangeism will beat the big drum of ‘saving the

union’ before the working class voters, and with that discord in

their ears they will be deaf to the cry of the helpless victims of

capitalist oppression.


Oh, words of burning truth! ‘For nearly

a century the question of Home Government has barred with triple steeel

every door of progress’!


The question of Home Government, the

professional advocacy of it, and the professional opposition to it, is

the greatest asset in the hands of reaction in Ireland, the

never-failing decoy to lure the workers into the bogs of religious

hatreds and social stagnation.


The Protestant workers of Belfast

are essentially democratic in their instincts, but not a single Belfast

loyalist M.P. voted for the Old Age Pensions' Act. The loyalist M.P.s

knew that the beating of the orange drum would drown every protest

within their constituencies.


The development of democracy in

Ireland has been smothered by the Union. Remove that barrier, throw the

Irish people back upon their own resources, make them realise that the


---

p.275




 causes of poverty, of lack of progress, of arrested civic

and national development, are then to be sought for within and not

without, are in their power to remove or perpetuate, and ere long that

spirit of democratic progress will invade and permeate all our social

and civic institutions.


Believing that that day is approaching,

the Socialist Party of Ireland seeks to prepare for it by laying now the

foundations of that socialist movement, whose duty it will be to guide

and direct the efforts of labour in Ireland, to find and fashion a

proper channel of expression and instrument of emancipation.


That

labour movement of the future, as well as the socialist movement of

to-day must, indeed, draw inspiration from the successes of our comrades

abroad, but must also shape its course to suit the conditions within our

own shores.


The Socialist Party of Ireland recognises and most

enthusiastically endorses the principle of internationalism, but it

realises that that principle must be sought through the medium of

universal brotherhood rather than by self-extinction of distinct nations

within the political maw of over-grown Empires.


When once all the

socialists in Ireland recognise this principle, and unite with us, they

will have cause to wonder at the readiness with which the workers of

Ireland will respond to the socialist appeal.


If all the

socialists in Ireland who waste their time in cursing the

unprogressiveness of the Irish workers, had only sufficient moral

courage to declare themselves, they would be astonished at the multitude

of their numbers, and would then realise that they were strong enough

to ensure respect and toleration.


Until they do, we will be

compelled to see Irish tory employers hiding their sweatshops behind

orange flags, and Irish home rule landlords using the green sunburst of

Erin to cloak their rack-renting in the festering slums of our Irish

towns.

THE BELFAST

LABOUR MEETING AND THE HOME RULE BILL, 1912
--------------------------------------------------------


RESOLVED: That

this meeting of workingmen and women of Belfast welcomes the project of

the establishment of an Irish Parliament as opening the way for much

needed social reform and the reunion of the Irish democracy hitherto

divided upon antiquated sectarian lines, but considers that in the

interests of democracy in this country more facilities should be offered

for securing a full and proper representation of the people of Ireland;

and we, therefore, demand that provision be made in the Bill for payment

of members and election expenses, proportional representation, and the

enfranchisement of women; and also that the proposed Senate be dropped

from the Bill, as we consider that experience has proven double chambers

of legislature to be useless and dangerous.


That a copy of this

resolution be sent to the leaders of the various parties in Parliament,

and also to the Parliamentary representatives of Belfast.


**Note by Thomas Johnson*:*


This resolution

was drafted by James Connolly for submission to a mass meeting in St.

Mary's Hall, Belfast, after the introduction of the Home Rule Bill in

1912.

BELFAST MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS

JANUARY 1913 DOCK WARD: ELECTION OF A COUNCILLOR *To the

Electors*:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


LADIES AND

GENTLEMEN,


In view of the fact that the National

Health Insurance Act comes into working operation on January 13, and

that one of the governing bodies to administer that Act will be an

Insurance Commission partly elected by the City Council, it is felt,

because of the well-known hostility to labour of our present

representatives, that some steps should be taken to have a labour representative on the Council in order to try and prevent enemies of the

working class being sent from that Council to the Insurance Commission.

For this reason a General Meeting of the Irish Transport and General

Workers' Union, very largely composed of residents in this Ward,

unanimously decided to ask me to contest Dock Ward in the labour

interest. The Belfast Trades and Labour Council also unanimously passed

a resolution approving of this contest and recommending the labour

candidate to the electors. As the Irish Trades Congress at its recent

meeting in Clonmel also declared in favour of organised labour in

Ireland taking steps to secure independent labour representation, I feel

compelled to accept this duty, and therefore I ask your hearty support

in our resolve to capture this seat, and thus let the voice of labour be

heard in the City Council, in spite of the stupid, intolerant, and

labour-hating gang who rule there.


I desire to be returned in

order to advocate, among other 


---

p.278


 things, that the Act for the

feeding of children at school at present in force in Great Britain, be

applied to Ireland. We have a right to demand equal treatment for Irish

and British workers, and as the British workers have secured that their

children must be fed before being educated (because it is impossible to

educate hungry children), we also claim that when the poverty, or

neglect, of the parents is such that the children are suffering, that

the Local Authorities should be empowered to make provision for the

supply of at least one good meal per day to each child. To those who

object that this would ‘pauperise’ the children, I answer that the

children of the working class have as much right to be maintained thus

as have the children of royalty. If it does not pauperise the one it

cannot pauperise the other.


The Corporation of Dublin and many

other Public Boards in Ireland have declared for this measure; it is

time Belfast City Council was interesting itself more about such matters

and less about the perpetuation of the religious discords that make

Belfast a byword among civilised nations.


My general attitude, if

elected, will be to insist upon the importance of the interests of

labour being studied; that wherever possible all Corporation work be

done by direct employment of labour; that the trade union clause be

enforced in all Corporation contracts; that a minimum wage of at least

6*d*. per hour be established for all Corporation employees;

that membership in a trade union be made compulsory for all wage-earners

in Corporation employment; and that the Tramways Committee and its

manager be compelled to supply covered cars for workers, morning and

evening.


As every citizen in Belfast is interested in the proper

administration of the Harbour, I favour the abolition of the present

undemocratic and unrepresentative Board and the establishment in its

place of a Harbour Board elected on the same franchise and at the same

time as the Aldermen of the 


---

p.279


 city. If elected, I will move

that the City Council promote a bill on these lines.


I stand as a

labour candidate, totally independent of any political party. But as the

personal views of a candidate cannot be ignored—and as mine are

likely to be misrepresented—I judge it well to state mine here

that I may at least be heard in my own defence.


Believing that

the present system of society is based upon the robbery of the working

class, and that capitalist property cannot exist without the plundering

of labour, I desire to see capitalism abolished, and a democratic system

of common or public ownership erected in its stead. This democratic

system, which is called socialism, will, I believe, come as a result of

the continuous increase of power of the working class. Only by this

means can we secure the abolition of destitution, and all the misery,

crime, and immorality which flow from that unnecessary evil. All the

reform legislation of the present day is moving in that direction even

now, but working class action on above lines will secure that direct,

voluntary, conscious, and orderly co-operation by all for the good of

all, will more quickly replace the blundering and often reluctant

legislation of capitalist governments.


As a lifelong advocate of

national independence for Ireland, I am in favour of Home Rule, and

believe that Ireland should be ruled, governed, and owned by the people

of Ireland.


I believe that men and women having to face the

battle of life together, could face it better were all enjoying the same

political rights.


Fellow workers: I leave my case in your hands.

As a trade union official, I stand for the class to which I belong. If

you are content to be represented by men belonging to some section of

the master class, then do not vote for me, but if you want your cause

represented from Dock Ward by one of your own class, who will battle for

your rights, who is 


---

p.280


 the determined enemy of the domination

of class over class, of nation over nation, of sex over sex, who will at

all times stand for the cause of the lowly-paid and oppressed, then vote

for


Yours fraternally, JAMES

CONNOLLY.

TO THE

LINEN SLAVES OF BELFAST
-------------------------------


FELLOW-WORKERS,


Your condition,

and the condition of the sweated women of all classes of labour in

Belfast, has recently become the subject of discussion on all the

political platforms of England, and of long articles in all the most

widely read newspapers and magazines of both countries. Almost

unanimously they agree in condemning the conditions under which you

work, your miserable wages, the abominable system of fining which

prevails, and the slaughtering speed at which you are driven. It is

pointed out that the conditions of your toil are unnecessarily hard,

that your low wages do not enable you to procure sufficiently

nourishing food for yourselves or your children, and that as a result of

your hard work, combined with low wages, you are the easy victims of

disease, and that your children never get a decent chance in life, but

are handicapped in the race of life before they are born.


All

this is to-day admitted by every right-thinking man and woman in these

Islands. Many Belfast Mills are slaughterhouses for the women and

penitentiaries for the children. But while all the world is deploring

your conditions, they also unite in deploring your slavish and servile

nature in submitting to them; they unite in wondering of what material

these Belfast women are made, who refuse to unite together and fight to

better their conditions.


Irish men have proven themselves to be

heroes in fighting to abolish the tyranny of landlordism. Irish women

fought heroically in the same cause. Are the Irish working women of

Belfast not of the same race? Can they not unite to fight the slavery of

capitalism as courageously as their sisters on the 


---

p.282


 farms of

Ireland united to fight the slavery of Irish landlordism? Public opinion

in these islands is anxious to help you, but public opinion cannot help

you unless you are ready to help yourselves.


Especially do we

appeal to the spinners, piecers, layers, and doffers. The slavery of the

Spinning-room is the worst and least excusable of all. Spinning is a

skilled trade, requiring a long apprenticeship, alert brains, and nimble

fingers. Yet for all this skill, for all those weary years of learning,

for all this toil in a super-heated atmosphere, with clothes drenched

with water, and hands torn and lacerated as a consequence of the

speeding up of the machinery, a qualified spinner in Belfast receives a

wage less than some of our pious millowners would spend weekly upon a

dog. And yet the Spinning-room is the key to the whole industry. A

general stoppage in the Spinning-rooms of Belfast would stop all the

linen industry, factories and warerooms alike, Reelers and spinners

united control the situation. Disorganised as they are to-day, they are

the helpless slaves of soulless employers. United as they might be, as

they ought to be, as we are determined they shall be, they could lift

themselves into the enjoyment of prosperity and well-paid healthful

labour. As a first step to that end, we wish to propose a programme of

industrial reform to be realised in the near future, and we invite all

our toiling sisters to enrol in our Society—the Irish Textile

Workers' Union—whose Belfast headquarters is at 50, York Street,

in order that we may unitedly, and at a given moment, fight for its

success.


We demand that the entire Linen Industry be put under

the Sweated Industries Act, which gives power to a Trades Board, on

which employees and employers are represented, to fix the minimum wages

for the whole.


Under that Act the wages of women in the Clothing

Operatives Trade has been already fixed at a minimum wage of 3d. per

hour. Until the extension to the Linen Industry of that Act, we demand

and pledge ourselves as a Union to 


---

p.283


 fight for a minimum wage

of 3d. per hour for all qualified spinners, proportionate increases for

all lower grades in the Spinning-room, and increases in the piece rates

for the Reeling-room and all departments in piece work; abolition of

fines for lost time; all stoppages to be at the same rates as the daily

pay per hour.


We also demand from Government the appointment of a

competent Woman Inspector for the Belfast District exclusively, in order

that the inspection of our mills, factories, and warerooms may be a

constant reality, instead of the occasional farce it is to-day.


United action can secure every point on this modest programme within

less than a year. It depends upon you, the working women of Belfast. If

you have courage enough, faith enough in yourselves and in each other,

you can win. Most of this programme can be won by direct industrial

action, by a General Strike for it if need be; the rest will be conceded

by Government as soon as you show yourselves in earnest in your demands

for it.


To make easy the work of organising, we are prepared to

establish an office or Women's Club-room in each district, if the

request for the same is made by a sufficient number of members. Take

advantage of this offer, give in your name to us at this office, or to

any of your collectors, and we will welcome you as sisters, and enrol

you as comrades in the coming battle for juster conditions.


Should this manifesto come into the hand of any not themselves

sufferers, but willing to help in the coming battle, if they communicate

with us we shall be prepared to enrol them as auxiliaries, and welcome

their help.


Sisters and Fellow-workers, talk this matter over, do

not be frightened by the timid counsels and fears of weaklings. Be

brave. Have confidence in yourselves. Talk about success, and you will

achieve success. . ..

THE HUMOURS

OF POLITICS
------------------------


#### 1


Many of our readers

are hardly aware of the fact that although Mr. William O'Brien,

M.P.,[12](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note012.html'))


---

p.288


 it

is now excommunicated by the United Irish League, and its bitterest foe,

vet he is the founder, inspirer, and whilst it was an active force in

agrarian struggles, was the chief financier and leader of that League.

But such is the case.


For a long time the cities of Ireland, and

Dublin in particular, remained callous and cold to the appeals of the

League. They regarded it as a peasants' or as an agricultural movement,

pure and simple, and would have nothing to do with it. But the

politicians wanted the cities, and so a concerted attack was made upon

Dublin.


Dublin, understand, was and is important politically in

Ireland because even the peasantry, who in most countries are jealous of

the capital, in Ireland do not trust a movement which cannot claim the

intellectual adhesion of the capital.


Hence, the hosts of the

United Irish League, backed up by all the financial resources of Mr.

O'Brien, and the concerted powers of the Home Rule press, set out to

make Dublin a tributary of the League, whether it would or not.


A

band was hired, also a gang of corner boys or loafers to cheer the

speaker, and if need be, break the head of any opponent. Then ‘great

meetings’ were announced in all the various districts. All United

Irish League gatherings are ‘great meetings’ when they are not

‘magnificent demonstrations’.


The same gang of corner boys

made up the meeting on each occasion. At Inchicore they were addressed

by the orators as the ‘unconquered democracy of Inchicore’, at Wood

Quay they were the ‘sterling working class of Wood Quay Ward’, at

Drumcondra, they were the ‘patriot men of Drumcondra’, 


---

p.286




at Arran Quay they stood for the ‘true and tried men of Arran

Quay’, and in the Harbour Division they responded enthusiastically as

the orators praised their record as ‘citizen voters in that *Gibraltar* of Irish

Nationalism—the Harbour Division of Dublin’.


And each

day the newspapers described the same gang differently, and waxed

eloquent in their leading columns upon the magnificent rally of the

working class of Dublin to the ranks of the United Irish League.


And the readers down the country and the Irish in Great Britain

swelled with exaltation as they read of the great reception the Dublin

workers gave to the orators of the League. Indeed it was primarily for

the benefit of the readers down the country and in Great Britain that

the meetings were arranged.


But as the Dublin workers saw the

corner boys marched back and forwards across their city to pose as the

residents in the various wards and districts, and as they read in the

papers the list of the committees in charge, and saw there the names

principally of pawnbrokers, slum landlords, publicans, and sweaters,

what wonder that they treated the whole affair with contempt.

Anybody who wants to defend

faith and fatherland very badly can get a job up north just now.

Carson's army is out on the warpath demanding the blood of the

‘Papists’, and ‘Wee Joe Devlin’ has been lecturing in

Belfast upon Isaac Butt, whilst the organisation of which

he is head is organising scabbery in Dublin, faith and fatherland is

being attacked from all sides, and the Hibernian attack, under cover of

defending the Pope, will be more harmful than the orangemen who save the

Pope under cover of attacking the faith.


The head of the Ancient

Order of Hibernians praising Isaac 


---

p.287


 Butt, a Protestant Home

Ruler, is very amusing considering that if Isaac Butt was alive every

Hibernian in Ireland would be bound to oppose him even for the humblest

position in Ireland. The Catholics of Ireland are the most tolerant

people in Ireland—always have been—but the aim of the

‘Hibs’, is to convert this tolerant people into a nation of

furious bigots and sectarian patriarchs. They stink in the nostrils of

every honest man and woman.


The Municipal Elections in Dublin

never fail to provide mirth for the multitude. The fun has already

begun in Merchants' Quay Ward, where Andrew Breslan, a working

carpenter and nominee of the Dublin Labour Party, is being opposed by

Mr. John Scully, High Sheriff of Dublin City. Scully is running in the

interests of the United Irish League and high rents, slum tenements,

rotten stair-cases, stinking yards, high death rates, low wages,

Corporation jobbery and margarine wrapped up in butter paper.


Also several other things. Mr. Scully is a provision merchant: as

such he is bound to furnish provisions upon the demand of his customers,

and as High Sheriff he is bound to provide hangmen upon the demand of

the British Government; or be a hangman himself if the supply of

professional hangmen failed.


If Robert Emmet was to be hanged

to-morrow, and the professional hangman went on strike, Mr. Scully is

bound by his oath of office to do the job and hang the patriot.


Therefore to hear Mr. Scully and his spouters talk of ‘fighting in

the sacred cause of patriotism’ is one of these delightful pieces of

humour that only the Sham Squire or James Carey could properly

appreciate and enjoy.


If you vote against the Labour Candidates

this coming election, you will vote to declare yourselves in favour of

more doses of: disease-infested tenements; slaughter of the children

of the poor; high rents; low wages; increasing death rate; 


---

p.288


 wretchedly-lit working class streets; baton charges on

inoffensive crowds; police perjury; police indecencies of language

against girl strikers; police brutalities upon babies and old men and

women; hatred of the working class by magistrates upon the bench;

journalistic slanders upon the working class; journalistic filth upon

strikes and strikers; political intrigues against trades-unionism; Home

Rule and Unionist alliances in support of sweating; and more doses of

every kind of treason against justice, and hatred of those who stand for

the working class.


In the field we are now fighting upon, the

industrial field, labour was left to battle alone against every element

represented in the above list; in the fight upon the municipal battle

field the alliance of all those unclean elements is as real as upon the

industrial, though not so open. The virtue of the industrial fight is

that it brings all our enemies into the open; in the political fight the

enemies are the same but they can easier hide their treachery.


It

is for the workers to stand together and send the whole pack howling to

the depths together.

THE DUBLIN LOCK OUT: ON THE EVE
-------------------------------


Perhaps

before this issue of The Irish Worker is in the hands of

its readers the issues now at stake in Dublin will be brought to a final

determination. All the capitalist newspapers of Friday last*,* join in urging, or giving favourable

publicity to the views of others urging the employers of Dublin to join

in a general lock-out of the members of the Irish Transport and General

Workers' Union. It is as well. Possibly some such act is necessary in

order to make that portion of the working class which still halts

undecided to understand clearly what it is that lies behind the

tyrannical and brow-beating attitude of the proprietors of the Dublin

tramway system.


The fault of the Irish Transport and General

Worker's Union! What is it? Let us tell it in plain language. Its fault

is this, that it found the labourers of Ireland on their knees, and has

striven to raise them to the erect position of manhood; it found them

with all the vices of slavery in their souls, and it strove to eradicate

these vices and replace them with some of the virtues of free men; it

found them with no other weapons of defence than the arts of the liar,

the lickspittle, and the toady, and it combined them and taught them to

abhor those arts and rely proudly on the defensive power of combination;

it, in short, found a class in whom seven centuries of social outlawry

had added fresh degradations upon the burden it bore as the members of a

nation suffering from the cumulative effects of seven centuries of

national bondage, and out of this class, the degraded slaves of slaves

more degraded still—for what degradation is more abysmal than that

of those who prostitute their manhood on the altar of

profit-mongering?—out of this class of slaves the labourers of

Dublin, the Irish Transport and General Worker's Union has created an

army of intelligent self-reliant men, 


---

p.290


 abhorring the old

arts of the toady, the lickspittle, and the crawler and trusting alone

to the disciplined use of their power to labour or to withdraw their

labour to assert and maintain their right as men. To put it in other

words, but words as pregnant with truth and meaning: the Irish Transport

and General Workers' Union found that before its advent the working

class of Dublin had been taught by all the educational agencies of the

country, by all the social influences of their masters, that this world

was created for the special benefit of the various sections of the

master class, that kings and lords and capitalists were of value; that

even flunkeys, toadies, *lickspittle* and poodle dogs had an honoured

place in the scheme of the universe, but that there was neither honour,

credit, nor consideration to the man or woman who toils to maintain them

all. Against all this the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has

taught that they who toil are the only ones that do matter, that all

others are but beggars upon the bounty of those who work with hand or

brain, and that this superiority of social value can at any time be

realised, be translated into actual fact, by the combination of the

labouring class. Preaching, organising, and fighting upon this basis,

the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has done what? If the

value of a city is to be found in the development of self-respect and

high conception of social responsibilities among a people, then the

Irish Transport and General Workers' Union found Dublin the poorest city

in these countries by reason of its lack of these qualities. And by

imbuing the workers with them, it has made Dublin the richest city in

Europe to-day, rich by all that counts for greatness in the history of

nations. It is then upon this working class so enslaved, this working

class so led and so enriched with moral purposes and high aims that the

employers propose to make general war. Shall we shrink from it; cower

before their onset? A thousand times no! Shall we crawl back into our

slums, abase our hearts, bow our knees, and crawl once more 


---

p.291




to lick the hand that would smite us? Shall we, who have been carving

out for our children a brighter future, a cleaner city, a freer life,

consent to betray them instead into the grasp of the blood-suckers from

whom we have dreamt of escaping? No, no, and yet again no! Let them

declare their lock-out; it will only hasten the day when the working

class will lock-out the capitalist class for good and all. If for

taking the side of the Tram men we are threatened with suffering, why we

have suffered before. But let them understand well that once they start

that ball rolling no capitalist power on earth can prevent it continuing

to roll, that every day will add to the impetus it will give to the

working class purpose, to the thousands it will bring to the working

class ranks and every added suffering inflicted upon the workers will be

a fresh obstacle in the way of moderation when the day of final

settlement arrives.


Yes, indeed, if it is going to be a wedding,

let it be a wedding; and if it is going to be a wake, let it be a wake:

*we are ready for either*.

### STATEMENT OF WORKERS'

REPRESENTATIVES


*The conference with the Dublin Employers'

Executive which had been arranged for through the instrumentality of the

Joint Board Delegates acting on the instructions of the National

Conference held in London on December 9,

reopened in the Shelbourne Hotel on December

18.*


*Previous to its reopening the delegates of the

National 


---

p.295


 Executives, and of the unions affected locally met

in conference in the Trades Hall, Capel Street, and after two sittings

decided unanimously to present the following as embodying the minimum

statement of the position of the workers.*


#### DUBLIN DISPUTE


That the

Employers of the City and County of Dublin agree to withdraw the

circulars, posters and forms of agreement (known as the Employers

Agreement) presented to their employees, embodying conditions governing

their employment in the several firms as from July 19th, 1913.


That the unions

affected agree as a condition of the withdrawal of such conditions and

forms of agreement governing employment in the firms affected, to

abstain from any form of sympathetic strike pending a Board of wages and

conditions of Employment being set up by March

17th, 1914.


And the conference also agrees that in

restoring relations no member shall be refused employment on the grounds

of his or her association with the dispute, and that no stranger shall

be employed *until* all the workers have been

re-engaged.


All cases of old workers not re-employed on February 1st, 1914, shall be considered at a

conference to be held not later than February

15th, 1914.


Upon the conference meeting on Thursday

morning the workers were informed that the employers considered that the

conference was a resumption of the previous one which broke up on Sunday

morning December 7, and therefore

stipulated that the immediate business in hand was the discussion of the

question upon which the previous conference had broken off, viz., the

question of reinstatement. The Labour delegates did not entirely agree

that this interpretation of the position was 


---

p.296


 the correct

one, but rather than peril the negotiations consented to make an effort

to proceed upon the lines indicated.


Several efforts were made to

obtain from the employers an indication of what they meant by the

phrases, ‘that they will make a *bona fide* effort to find

employment for as many as possible and as soon as they can’, and that

‘they will take on as many of their former employees as they can make

room for’. The Employers' Committee was asked to state the firms that

could not give reinstatement, or the proportion in which reinstatement

could be given immediately, but no information could be elicited.

Reference was made to the statement of Mr. Murphy in the press that all

but five per cent. of the men could go back to work immediately, and the

Labour representatives asked was there any indication of the extent to

which immediate reinstatement could be made now. The answer returned

stated that it was not, and further that Mr. Murphy's statement only

referred to five per cent. of the men whose places were not filled up.

This meant that Mr. Murphy was determined that even five per cent. of

the men whose places were not yet filled would be victimised, and is a

fair indication of the vindictive spirit of the employers.


Finding it impossible to come to any agreement or to receive any

information the Labour representatives resolved to lay the whole

matter before the Joint National Conferences. The latter body after

fully considering the question in all its bearings resolved finally to

instruct the delegation to bring back to the employers for further

consideration the document presented on Thursday morning. This was done

on Saturday, and the document handed in by Mr. Larkin at the request of

the Delegation. Upon it being handed in the Chairman of the Employers

asked Mr. Henderson if Mr. Larkin was speaking on behalf of both Labour

bodies, and was assured by that gentleman that Mr. Larkin spoke with the

full and unanimous endorsement of the whole National Conference and all

its 


---

p.297


 constituent parts. Then the Labour representatives

withdrew to allow the employers to consider the position. Upon

reassembling the following document was presented by the employers,

after which negotiations were broken off. 
> 
> The Committee
> 
> observe that the proposals put forward through Mr. Larkin this morning
> 
> are the same as those presented on Thursday morning, and bring us back
> 
> to the position in which we then stood.
> 
> 
> The clauses submitted
> 
> again to-day by the Representatives of the workers require the full
> 
> reinstatement by the Employers of all the workers. This would involve
> 
> the victimisation of many who have been employed since the dispute
> 
> began. The Employers cannot agree to dismiss men who have proved
> 
> suitable, but subject to this condition are willing and anxious to
> 
> re-employ their old hands as far and as soon as possible.
> 
> 
> The
> 
> members of the Committee have laboured to try and effect a settlement so
> 
> much needed and desired, and regret that their labours in conjunction
> 
> with those of the Joint Board representatives and the Trades Council
> 
> Delegates have not succeeded in arriving at an agreement.
> 
> 
> JOHN GOOD, 20-12-1913.




On

behalf of the representatives of the workers we wish to draw attention

to the fact that the employers insisted all through the negotiations

that the question of reinstatement should be left absolutely in the

hands of the employers, that we should trust entirely to their goodness

and generosity. Remember the fact that the employers had locked out

their workers, and had brought on this dispute in order to force upon us

an agreement 


---

p.298


 now universally repudiated and condemned by

all classes from Sir George Askwith's Court of Inquiry down till to-day,

as ‘contrary to individual liberty and one which no self-respecting

workman or body of workmen could possibly accept’. Remember this,

and remember also that the workers now out are out because they

protested against this insult to their self-respect, and resolved to

protect their individual liberty, and consider that we are asked to

surrender these men and women to the tender mercies of those who so

wantonly made war upon them. In view of this fact and the further fact

that our proposals now refused by the employers have been described by

such a broad-minded lover of peace as his Grace, Archbishop Walsh as

‘fair and reasonable—eminently reasonable’, and that these

proposals gave the employers every opportunity and sufficient time to

adjust their business. What other course was open to us than to

respectfully but firmly decline to surrender our brothers. We also

wish to draw the attention of the public to the fact that many of the

trade unions involved have had for some considerable time past

agreements with the employers stipulating for the exclusive employment

of trade union labour, and that all such agreements would be completely

destroyed by the acceptance of the employers' proposals. Thus they are

now trying to introduce the principle of nonunion labour in places where

such labour has not recently existed. In the building trades, for

instance, the rules call for three months' notice before such agreements

can be altered, yet the employers are now striving to undermine this

trade union position without any notice at all. And these are the men

who prate of breaches of agreement!


The workers' proposals gave

the employers full time, and only stipulated that within a certain

period another conference should be held to consider the question of the

workers still unemployed. No fairer proposal could be given. The

employers' proposal on the other hand demanded that the question of 


---

p.299


 re-employment should be left entirely to the generosity, the

ill-will, the forbearance, the malice, the fair-mindedness, the

vindictiveness, the passions and the prejudices of the employers who

four months ago set out to starve us into submission, and to drive us

back to slavery.


Under these circumstances the fight must go

on.

Representation*.

GLORIOUS DUBLIN!
----------------


To the readers of

 Forward possibly some sort of apology is due for the

non-appearance of my notes for the past few weeks, but I am sure that

they quite well understand that I was, so to speak, otherwise engaged.

On the day I generally write my little screed, I was engaged on the

31st of August in learning how to walk

around in a ring with about forty other unfortunates kept six paces

apart, and yet slip in a word or two to the poor devil in front of or

behind me without being noticed by the watchful prison warders.


The first question I asked was generally ‘say, what are you in

for’, Then the rest of the conversation ran thus:


‘For

throwing stones at the police’. ‘Well, I hope you did throw them

and hit’. ‘No, by G  
[*gap: authorial courtesy/extent: one word*]  
, that's the worst of it. I was pulled coming out of my own

house’.


‘Pulled’ is the Dublin word for arrested. It was

somewhat mortifying to me to know that I was the only person

apparently in prison who had really committed the crime for which I was

arrested. It gave me a sort of feeling that I was lowering the moral

tone of the prison by coming amongst such a crowd of blameless

citizens.


But the concluding part of our colloquy was a little

more encouraging. It usually finished in this way:


‘Are you in

the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union’?


‘Of course

I am’.


‘Good. Well if they filled all the prisons in Ireland

they can't beat us, my boy’.


‘No, thank God, they can't;

we'll fight all the better when we get out’.


And there you

have the true spirit. Baton charges; prison 


---

p.301


 cells, untimely

death and acute starvation—all were faced without a murmur, and in

face of them all, the brave Dublin workers never lost faith in their

ultimate triumph, never doubted but that their organisation would emerge

victorious from the struggle. This is the great fact that many of our

critics amongst the British labour leaders seem to lose sight of. The

Dublin fight is more than a trade union fight; it is a great class

struggle, and recognised as such by all sides. We in Ireland feel that

to doubt our victory would be to lose faith in the destiny of our

class.


I heard of one case where a labourer was asked to sign the

agreement forswearing the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union,

and he told his employer, a small capitalist builder, that he refused to

sign. The employer, knowing the man's circumstances, reminded him that

he had a wife and six children who would be starving within a week.

The reply of this humble labourer rose to the heights of sublimity.

‘It is true, sir’, he said, ‘they will starve; but I would rather

see them go out one by one in their coffins than that I should disgrace

them by signing that’. And with head erect he walked out to share

hunger and privation with his loved ones. Hunger and privation—and

honour.


Defeat, bah! How can such a people be defeated? His case

is typical of thousands more. Take the case of the United Builders

Labourers' Trade Union, for instance. This was a rival union to the

Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. Many sharp passages had

occurred between them, and the employers counted confidently upon their

co-operation in the struggle; Mr. William Martin Murphy especially

praising them and exulting in their supposed acquiescence in his plans.

Remember also that they were a dividing society, dividing their funds at

the end of each year, and therefore without any strike funds. When the

members of their union were asked to sign the agreement, promising never

to join or help the 


---

p.302


 Irish Transport and General Workers'

Union, not one man consented—but all over Dublin their 2,500

members marched out ‘to help the I. T. & G. W. U. boys’. Long ere

these lines are written, they have experienced all the horrors of

starvation, but with grim resolve they have tightened their belts and

presented an unyielding front to the enemy.


It is a pleasure to

me to recall that I was a member of their Union before I went to

America, and that they twice ran me as their candidate for Dublin City

Council before the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union was

dreamed of.


What is true of that union is also true of most of

the tradesmen*.* All are showing wonderful

loyalty to their class. Coachbuilders, sawyers, engineers, bricklayers,

each trade that is served by general labourers, walks out along with the

Irish Transport and General Workers' Union boys; refuses to even promise

to work with any one who signs the employers' agreement, and, cheering,

lines up along with their class.


Or think of the heroic women and

girls. Did they care to evade the issue, they might have remained at

work, for the first part of the agreement asks them to merely repudiate

the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and as women they are

members of the Irish Women Workers' Union, not of the Irish Transport

and General Workers' Union. But the second part pledges them to refuse

to ‘help’ the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union—and

in every shop, factory and sweating hell-hole in Dublin, as the

agreement is presented, they march out with pinched faces, threadbare

clothes, and miserable footgear, but with high hopes, undaunted spirit,

and glorious resolve shining out of their eyes. Happy the men who will

secure such wives; thrice blessed the nation which has such girls as the

future mothers of the race! Ah, comrades, it is good to have lived in

Dublin in these days!


And then our friends write deprecatingly to

the British press of the ‘dislocation of trade’ involved in

sympathetic strikes, 


---

p.303


 of the ‘perpetual conflicts’ in

which they would involve great trade unions. To those arguments, if we

can call them such, our answer is sufficient. It it this: If the

capitalist class knew that any outrages upon a worker, any attack upon

labour, would result in a prompt dislocation of trade, perhaps national

in its extent; that the unions were prepared to spend their last copper

if necessary rather than permit a brother or sister to be injured, then

the knowledge would not only ensure a long cessation from industrial

skirmishing such as the unions are harassed by to-day, it would not only

ensure peace to the unions, but what is of vastly more importance, it

would ensure to the individual worker a peace from slave-driving and

harassing at his work such as the largest unions are apparently unable

to guarantee under present methods.


Mark, when I say ‘prepared

to spend their last copper if necessary’, I am not employing merely

a rhetorical flourish, I am using the words literally. As we believe

that in the socialist society of the future the entire resources of the

nation must stand behind every individual, guaranteeing him against

want, so to-day our unions must be prepared to fight with all their

resources to safeguard the rights of every individual member.


The adoption of such a principle, followed by a few years of fighting

on such lines to convince the world of our earnestness, would not only

transform the industrial arena, but would revolutionise politics. Each

side would necessarily seek to grasp the power of the state to

reinforce its position, and politics would thus become what they ought

to be, a reflex of the industrial battle, and lose the power to

masquerade as a neutral power detached from economic passions or

motives.


At present I regret to say labour politicians seem to be

losing all reality as effective aids to our struggles on the industrial

battlefield, are becoming more and more absorbed in questions of

administration, or taxation, and only occasionally, as in the 


---

p.304


 miners' national strike, really rise to a realisation of their

true role of parliamentary outposts of the industrial army.


The

parliamentary tail in Britain still *persists* in wagging the British industrial dog.

Once the dog really begins to assert his true position, we will be

troubled no more by carping critics of labour politics, nor yet with

labour politicians' confessions of their own impotence in such great

crises as that of the railway strike or the Johannesburg massacres.


Nor yet would we see that awful spectacle we have seen lately of

labour politicians writing to the capitalist press to denounce the

methods of a union which, with 20,000 men and women locked out in one

city, is facing an attempt of 400 employers to starve its members back

into slavery.


And thou, Brutus, that you should play the enemy's

game at such a crisis! Every drop of ink you spilled in such an act

stopped a loaf of bread on its way to some starving family.

THE CHILDREN, THE

IRISH TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS' UNION AND THE ARCHBISHOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our good friend the Daily Citizen[13](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note013.html')) describes the scenes attendant upon the

intended departure of some Dublin children to Great Britain, under the

auspices of a committee organised there for the purpose of taking care

of children of the locked out workers, as ‘the most extraordinary

scene in this most extraordinary industrial conflict in this

country’.


We do not wonder at our British friends being

surprised, nor at them being horrified, nor at them being scandalised

and shocked at the treatment to which they have been subjected, and the

vile aspersions cast upon their motives. For ourselves we anticipated it

all, and have never been enthusiastic towards the scheme.


We

realised that their children are about all the workers of Dublin have

left to comfort them, that amidst the squalor and wretchedness of their

surroundings the love of their little ones shines like a star of

redemption, and that to part with their dear ones would be like

wrenching their hearts asunder. We realised, further, what it is very

difficult to make even the most friendly of the British realise, that

Great Britain is still an alien country to Ireland, and that even the

splendid comradeship and substantial aid of to-day can hardly expect to

obliterate immediately the evil results upon our intercourse of long

generations of oppression during the period when class rule stood in

Ireland for Great Britain, and symbolised all Britain's relations with

Ireland. And we also knew that some of the darkest memories of Ireland

were associated with British attempts to stab the heart of Ireland

through systematic abduction of the bodies and corruption of the minds

of Irish children.




---

p.306


Therefore we felt instinctively

that the well-meant move of Mrs. Montefiore and her colleagues would

arouse in Ireland hostilities and suspicions they could not conceive of,

and would not believe were we to attempt the task of making the matter

clear. Hence, while placing no obstacle in the way of its fulfilment,

and feeling deeply a sense of gratitude towards the noble British men

and women of our class who have so unreservedly thrown open their homes

for the purpose of sheltering our stricken little ones, we have

nevertheless felt that the scheme was bound to be taken advantage of to

our detriment by all the hostile elements who surround us, but usually

fear to reveal their hostility. We know that people ‘willing to wound,

and yet afraid to strike’, swarm everywhere on the flanks of the

labour movement in Ireland, and we also know that the men and women in

charge of that labour movement know how to keep these people disarmed

and ineffective; but that the men and women in the British labour

movement have none of that knowledge of our enemies nor of our methods

for neutralising their hostility.


But when we have said this we

have said all that our own position demands. Having said it, we must

protest in the name of the whole labour movement of this country against

the foul and libellous accusations brought against the noble-minded

ladies who have been in charge of the scheme. One scoundrel in clerical

garb is said to have stated on Wednesday that the children were being

‘brought to England by trickery, fraud and corruption for

proselytising purposes’. Nothing more venomous and unfounded was

ever spewed out of a lying mouth in Ireland since the *seoinin* clergy at the bidding of an English

politician hounded Parnell to his grave. Mrs. Montefiore had given his

Grace Archbishop Walsh her assurance that wherever the children went,

the local Roman Catholic clergy would be given their names and

addresses, and requested to take charge of them, and see that they

attended to their duties 


---

p.307


 as Catholic children. His Grace

felt that, despite that assurance, and without doubting it in the least,

there would still be dangers. But not for one moment did he impugn the

motives of the ladies in question. His instincts as a gentleman, and

his own high sense of honour forbade. But what these instincts and that

honour forbade his Grace to do was unblushingly done on Wednesday by a

cleric destitute of both. We leave the gentleman in question to be dealt

with by his Grace, who will assuredly see that in his diocese the garb

of a priest is not made as a shield for the acts and language of a

scoundrel*.*


The utterances of his

Grace the Archbishop on the question at issue deserve and no doubt will

receive, the earnest consideration of every thoughtful man and woman in

Ireland. Nobody wants to send the children away—the Irish

Transport and General Workers' Union least of all desires such a

sacrifice. But neither do we wish the children to starve. We love the

children of Ireland, we are sacrificing our own ease and comfort in

order that the future of these children may be sweeter and happier than

the lot of their fathers and mothers. We know that progress cannot be

made without sacrifice, and we do not shrink from the sacrifice involved

in fighting for freedom now in order that future generations may build

upon the results of our toil. But the master class of Dublin calmly and

coldbloodedly calculate upon using the sufferings of the children to

weaken the resistance of the parents. They wish to place us upon the

horns of a dilemma. Either the parents should resist, and then the

children will starve, or the parents will surrender, and the children

will grow up in slavery, and live to despise the parents who bequeathed

to them such an evil heritage.


Your Grace, we are resolved to

fight Death itself—the death some of us have already suffered, the

death your humble servant has in the same cause looked in the face

without flinching—it would be preferable to surrendering the

Dublin workers 


---

p.308


 again to the hell of slavery out of which

they are emerging. Your Grace, we will fight![14](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note014.html'))


But if your Grace is as

solicitous about the poor bodies of those children as we know you to be

about their souls, or even if you are but one tenth part as solicitous,

may we suggest to you or your laymen that your duty is plain. See to it

that the force of public opinion, that the power of the press, that all

the engines at your command are brought to bear upon the inhuman

monsters who control the means of employment in Dublin to make them

realise their duties to the rest of the community. We have done our

part, we have told the Lord Mayor, we have told Sir George Askwith, we

have told the Dublin Industrial Peace Committee, that we are ready to

negotiate. All of these admit that our position is reasonable, all of

them have been spat upon with scorn by the employers, and all of them

shrink in cowardice from taking the next logical step and concentrating

public feeling and public financial support in favour of the workers,

the only party to the dispute that all along has declared its readiness

to bow to public opinion.


These people, we repeat, have shrunk in

cowardice from their manifest duty. Will you undertake it? It is your

duty equally with theirs. To you we repeat our offer: we are willing to

accept the mediation of any party whose functions will be strictly

limited to bringing the two parties together in a conference to thrash

out their differences. We are prepared to meet the representatives of

all the employers, or meet any individual employer, as we have done

satisfactorily in many cases already. This is our offer to you. And we

repeat to you what we have said to the others: 
> 
> *If
> 
> the employers reject your offer of mediation and still declare their
> 
> contempt for any public opinion they cannot rig in advance, then it is
> 
> your manifest duty to organise public support for the workers to defeat
> 
> their soulless employers*.
> 
> 
> 




We have read

your Grace's character in vain if you shrink 


---

p.309


 from that

task, or fail in that duty. The plight of the children, and your concern

for them should be your warrant for acting, if any warrant other than

your high position was needed. Meanwhile, come weal or woe, in good

repute or evil, we are prepared to fight, because we feel that this

fight is a fight for the future, a brighter future for

IMPORTATION v. DEPORTATION
--------------------------



It is a crime to

deport Dublin children in order to feed, clothe and house them better

than they were before. All the newspapers are against it.


It is

not a crime to import English scabs to take the bread out of the mouths

of Dublin men, women and children, and to reduce them to slavery.[15](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note015.html'))


The newspapers are overjoyed about it.

Fellow-workers! All the collection of hypocrites and sweaters who

paraded our docks and railway stations a few days ago, and prostituted

the name of religion to suit the base ends of those who for generations

have grown fat by grinding the faces of the poor, are silent as the

grave in face of the importation of British scabs. They poured insult,

lies and calumny upon the British labour men and women who offered our

children the shelter and comfort of their homes in the day of our trial;

but they allow British blacklegs to enter Dublin without a word of

protest! Will you allow this? If not, you must rally!


Rally and

fight as you never fought before. Begin, Monday,November 10th. All individual picketing is abolished,

and all persons on strike or lock-out must attend a mass picket outside

the doors or gates of their former employment at the usual hours of

labour, commencing at the first hours of opening in the morning.


No food tickets will be issued at Liberty Hall in future except to

casual labourers, who must sign their names each day between the hours

of 9.30 a.m. and 12 noon. Permanent men will receive food tickets from

their respective committee men, delegates or shop stewards, to whom they

must report in the morning, and who have the power to refuse if they

consider that the member applying has neglected to attend the mass 


---

p.311


 picket. Any member found hanging around Liberty Hall without

special reason will forfeit strike allowance.


Fellow-workers—the employers are determined to starve you into

submission, and if you resist, to club you, jail you, and kill you. We

defy them! If they think they can carry on their industries without you,

we will, in the words of the Ulster Orangeman, *Take steps to prevent it*.


It is your duty to find

the ways and means. Be men now, or be for ever slaves.

A TITANIC

STRUGGLE
-------------------


What is the truth about the Dublin dispute? What was

the origin of the Dublin dispute? These are at present the most

discussed questions in the labour world of these islands, and I have

been invited by the editor of the Daily Herald to try and

shed a little light upon them for the benefit of its readers. I will try

and be brief and to the point, whilst striving to be also clear.


In the year 1911 the National Seamen's and Firemen's Union, as a last

desperate expedient to avoid extinction, resolved upon calling a general

strike in all the home ports. At that time the said Union*,* as the lawyers would say, was, more or less,

of an ishmael among trade unions. It was not registered, in most places

it was not even affiliated to the local Trades Union Councils, and its

national officials had always been hostile to the advanced labour

movement. They believed, seemingly, in playing a lone hand. Perhaps the

general discredit into which it had been brought by the curiously

inconsistent action of its leaders in closely identifying themselves

with one of the orthodox political parties, and at the same time calling

for the aid in industrial conflicts of the labour men whom they fought

and slandered in political labour contests, had something to do with the

general weakness and impending bankruptcy of the National Seamen's and

Firemen's Union, at the time it issued its call in 1911.


At all

events the call was in danger of falling upon vain ears, and was, in

fact, but little *heeded* until the

Irish Transport and General Workers' Union began to take a hand in the

game. As ships came into the Port of Dublin, after the issue of the

call, each ship was held up by the dockers under the orders of James

Larkin until its crew joined the union, and signed on 


---

p.313


 under

union conditions and rates of pay. Naturally, this did not please the

shipowners and merchants of Dublin. But the delegates of the Irish

Transport and General Workers' Union up and down the docks preached most

energetically the doctrine of the sympathetic strike, and the doctrine

was readily assimilated by the dockers and carters. It brought the

union into a long and bitter struggle along the quays, a struggle which

cost it thousands of pounds, imperilled its very existence, and earned

for it the bitterest hatred of every employer and sweater in the city,

every one of whom swore they would wait their chance to ‘get even with

Larkin and his crew’.


The sympathetic strike having worked so

well for the seamen and firemen, the Irish Transport and General

Workers' Union began to apply it ruthlessly in every labour dispute. A

record of the victories it has won for other trade unions would surprise

a good many of its critics. A few cases will indicate what, in the hands

of Larkin and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, it has won

for some of the skilled trades.


When the coachmakers went on

strike the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union took over all the

labourers, paid them strike pay, and kept them out until the coachmakers

won. The latter body are now repaying us by doing scab work while we are

out.


The mill-sawyers existed for twenty years in Dublin without

recognition. The sympathetic strike by our union won them recognition

and an increase of pay.


The stationary engine drivers, the

cabinetmakers, the sheet metal workers, the carpenters, and, following

them all the building trades got an increase through our control of the

carting industry. As did also the girls and men employed in Jacob's

biscuit factory. In addition to this work for others we won for our own

members the following increases within the last two years: cross channel

dockers got, since the strike in the City of Dublin Steam Packet

Company, an increase of 


---

p.314


 wages of 3*s*. per week.

In the case of the British and Irish Company the increase, levelling it

up with the other firms meant a rise of 6*s*. per week. For men

working for the Merchants' Warehousing Company 3*s*. per week,

general carriers 2*s*. to 3*s*., coal fillers

halfpenny per ton, grain bushellers 1*d*. per ton, men and boys

in the bottle-blowing works from 2*s*. to 10*s*. per

week of an increase, mineral water operatives 4*s*. to

6*s*. per week, and a long list of warehouses in which girls

were exploited were compelled to give some slight modification of the

inhuman conditions under which their employees were labouring.


As

Mr. Havelock Wilson, General Secretary, National Seamen's and Firemen's

Union, has mentioned the strike on the City of Dublin Steam Packet

Company as an instance of our erratic methods, it may be worth while to

note that as a result of that strike some of his sailors got an increase

of 5*s*. 6*d*. per week.


In addition to the

cases enumerated I might also mention that the labourers on the Dublin

and South-Eastern Railway got increases of 6*s*. per week, and

those in the Kingstown Gas Works got increases varying from

3*s*. to 10*s*. per week per man.


All of these

increases were the result of the sympathetic strike policy, first

popularised by its success in winning the battle for the Seamen and

Firemen—who are now asked to repudiate it.


These things

well understood explain the next act in the unfolding of the drama.

Desiring to make secure what had been gained, Mr. Larkin formulated a

scheme for a Conciliation Board. This was adopted by the Trades Council,

at least in essence, and eventually came before the Employers'

Executive, or whatever the governing committee of that body is named.

After a hot discussion it was put to the vote. Eighteen employers voted

to accept a Conciliation Board, three voted against. Of that three,

William Martin Murphy was one. On finding himself in the minority he

rose and vowed that in spite of them he would ‘smash the Conciliation

Board’. Within three 


---

p.315


 days he kept his word by

discharging two hundred of his tramway traffic employees for being

members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and thus

forced on the strike of the tramway men. Immediately he appealed to all

the Dublin employers who had been forced into a semblance of decency by

Larkin and his colleagues, called to their memory the increases of wages

they were compelled to pay, and lured them on to a desperate effort to

combine and destroy the one labour force they feared.


The

employers, mad with hatred of the power that had wrested from them the

improved conditions, a few of which I have named, rallied round Murphy,

and from being one in a minority of three he became the leader and

organising spirit of a band of four hundred.


I have always told

our friends in Great Britain that our fight in Ireland was neither

inspired nor swayed by theories nor theorists. It grew and was hammered

out of the hard necessities of our situation. Here, in this brief

synopsis, you can trace its growth for yourselves. First a fierce desire

to save our brothers of the sea, a desire leading to us risking our own

existence in their cause. Developing from that an extension of the

principle of sympathetic action until we took the fierce beast of

capital by the throat all over Dublin, and loosened its hold on the

vitals of thousands of our class. Then a rally of the forces of capital

to recover their hold, and eventually a titanic struggle, in which the

forces of labour in Britain openly, and the forces of capital secretly,

became participants.


That is where we stand to-day. The struggle

forming our theories and shaping the policy, not only for us, but for

our class. To those who criticise us we can only reply: we fight as

conditions dictate; we meet new conditions with new policies. Those who

choose may keep old policies to meet new conditions. We cannot and *will* not try.

Herald , December 6, 1913.

A FIERY CROSS OR CHRISTMAS

BELLS
---------------------------------


While are writing this the one question agitating all

Dublin is whether this Christmas will see a relighting of the Fiery

Cross or the ringing of Christmas bells of peace and rejoicing. Possibly

no more grim commentary upon the so-called civilisation of to-day could

be instanced than that fact. Here we have a great city held up by a war

between two classes, and in that war the contending classes are

represented, on the one hand, by those who control the wealth, the

capital, the armed forces and all the means of coercion; whilst, on the

other hand, all that is represented is toiling men and women, with no

assets except their brains and hands, and no powers except the power and

capacity to suffer for a principle they esteem more valuable than life

itself.


But to the side of this latter class has been drawn

gradually as if by a magnet all the intellect, the soul and the spirit

of the nation, all those who have learned to esteem the higher things of

life, to value the spirit more than the matter.


Publicists of all

kinds, philanthropists, literary men, lovers of their kind, poets,

brilliant writers, artists, have all been conquered by the valiant

heroism of the Dublin workers, have all been drawn within the ranks of

the friends of the fighters of labour—all have succumbed to the

magic charm of the unobtrusive men and women whose constancy amidst

sufferings has made this fight possible. Whoever signs the document of

settlement (if any is ever signed), whosoever is acclaimed as the great

one of the treaty of peace (if there ever is a treaty of peace) the real

heroes and conquerors are to be found in the slums, and in the prisons

where men, women and girls have 


---

p.317


 agonised and are agonising

in order that their class may not lose one step it has gained in its

upward toil to freedom.


These thoughts come crowding upon us as

we write. We think also that, despite all the adhesion of all the

brilliant ones and all those in the highest odour of sanctity to the

cause of the workers, the settlement is still in the hands of those who

control economic power. Poets, artists, authors, humanitarians and

archbishops may plead and beg for the ringing of the bells of Christmas

for ever. The final word still rests with those who control the money

bags; and thus we learn, hard facts teaching us, that in this gross

travesty of civilisation under which we live to-day neither soul nor

brains is the equal of gold. 
> 1. The
> 
> clinking of the silver dimes life's melody has marred,
>   
> And
> 
> nature's immemorial chimes are jangled, harsh and jarred.
> 





And so Dublin lies in the grip of the power of the

purse; and on this fateful Friday the issue still hangs trembling. A

few hours may determine whether the verdict will go forth for the joyous

ringing of the Bells of Peace or for the militant call to all lovers of

their kind to grasp and pass from hand to hand again the dread but

inspiring Fiery Cross.

THE ISOLATION OF DUBLIN
-----------------------


It is not necessary, I

presume, to remind our readers of the beginnings of the Dublin struggle.

Let us, just for convenience sake, take up the fight at the moment it

became a subject of national action on the part of the British Labour

movement.


A public meeting had been proclaimed in Dublin in a

brazen illegal manner. For declaring that this proclamation was illegal,

and advising their leaders to disregard it and stand to their rights, a

number of leaders of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union had

been arrested and imprisoned. A wholesale batoning of the people had

followed, and Dublin was the scene of the most unparalleled police

brutality.


An appeal was made to the British Trades Union

Congress, then happily sitting, and that body in the name of the

British working class nobly rose to the occasion, and pledged the credit

of the whole British labour movement to see their Dublin comrades

through the fight. As a result, the right of free speech was re-asserted

in Dublin, a supply of food was arranged for through the despatch of

specially chartered steamers, and a huge amount of money was raised to

enable the men and women of Dublin to keep the fight going. Never was

seen such enthusiasm in a labour fight. Trade unionists, socialists of

all kinds, anarchists, industrialists, syndicalists, all the varying and

hitherto discordant elements of the labour movement found a common

platform, were joined together in pursuit of a common object. Now,

permit me to underscore that point, and emphasise its great importance.

For long years we have been preaching to the labour movement the

necessity of concerted industrial action, telling it that the time was

rotten ripe for industrial unity, and declaring that as the interests of


---

p.319




 each were the concern of all, our organisations should be

rearranged with a view to the conserving of their common interests.


We found that to a large extent these ideas were taking root in the

minds of the workers, but that to a still larger extent the tacit

acceptance of our ideas failed to evoke concerted action built upon

these lines. The forces of our enemies were united and wielded with all

the precision and relentlessness with which the general staff of an army

would wield the battalions and brigades which formed the component parts

of that army, but the battalions and brigades of the army of labour when

engaged in battle had no efficient general staff to guide and direct the

whole army to the salvation of its individual units; and, worse still,

had none of that *esprit de corps* which

on the military battle-field would make the desertion of any section to

its fate an unthinkable course to the officers of the divisions not

engaged. We had seen at London, at Leith and elsewhere that whereas the

whole force of the Shipping Federation has been actively engaged in

fighting the dockers of these ports, the dockers and seamen of the other

ports had maintained the peace, and left their Leith or London brothers

to bear alone the full force of the Federation attack, instead of

meeting that attack by a movement against the flanks and rear of the

Federation in these other ports. We know that although much of this

blundering was due to the sectional jealousy of various union leaders,

much was also due to the fact that the conception of common action on a

national scale by the whole working class had not yet entered the minds

of the rank and file as a whole. Something had been

wanting—something that would make the minds of the workers more

responsive, more ready to accept the broader idea, and act upon its

acceptance. That something Dublin supplied.


The dramatic

suddenness with which the Dublin fight was thrust upon public attention,

the tragic occurrences of the first 


---

p.320


 few days—working

class martyrdom, the happy coincidence of a Trade Union Congress, the

intervention of British trade unionists to assert the right of public

meeting for Irish workers—filling the gap in the ranks caused by

the jailing of Irish Trade Union leaders, the brilliant inspiration of a

food ship, and last but not least the splendid heroism of the Dublin men

and women showing out against the background of the squalor and misery

of their houses.


There are times in history when we realise that

it is easier to convert a multitude than it ordinarily is to convert an

individual; when indeed ideas seem to seize upon the masses as

contra-distinguished by ordinary times when individuals slowly seize

ideas. The propagandist toils on for decades in seeming failure and

ignominy, when suddenly some great event takes place in accord with the

principles he has been advocating, and immediately he finds that the

seed he has been sowing is springing up in plants that are covering the

earth. To the idea of working class unity, to the seed of industrial

solidarity, Dublin was the great event that enabled it to seize the

minds of the masses, the germinating force that gave power to the seed

to fructify and cover these islands.


I say in all solemnity and

seriousness that in its attitude towards Dublin the working class

movement of Great Britain reached its highest point of moral

grandeur—attained for a moment to a realisation of that sublime

unity towards which the best in us must continually aspire. Could that

feeling but have been crystallised into organic expression, could we but

have had real statesmen amongst us who, recognising the wonderful leap

forward of our class, would have hastened to burn behind us the boats

that might make easy a retreat to the old ground of isolation and

division, could we have found labour leaders capable enough to declare

that now that the working class had found its collective soul it should

hasten to express itself as befitted that soul and not be fettered by

the rules, regulations 


---

p.321


 and codes of organisations conceived

in the olden outworn spirit of sectional jealousies; could these things

have but been vouchsafed to us, what a new world could now be opening

delightfully upon the vision of labour? Consider what Dublin meant to

you all! It meant that the whole force of organised labour should stand

behind each unit of organisation in each and all of its battles, that no

company, battalion or brigade should henceforth be allowed to face the

enemy alone, and that the capitalist would be taught that when he fought

a union anywhere he must be prepared to fight all unions everywhere.


For the first days and weeks of the struggle, the working

classes of Great Britain attained to the height of moral grandeur

expressed in that idea, all labour stood behind Dublin, and Dublin

rejoiced. Dublin suffered and agonised, but rejoiced that even in its

suffering it was the medium for the apostolate of a rejuvenating idea.

How often have I heard the responsive cheers to the question whether

they would be prepared to stand by others as these others had stood by

them!


And now? Dublin is isolated. We asked our friends of the

transport trade unions to isolate the capitalist class of Dublin, and we

asked the other unions to back them up. But no, they said we would

rather help you by giving you funds. We argued that a strike is an

attempt to stop the capitalist from carrying on his business, that the

success or failure of the strike depends entirely upon the success or

non-success of the capitalist to do without the strikers. If the

capitalist is able to carry on his business without the strikers, then

the strike is lost, even if the strikers receive more in strike pay than

they formerly did in wages. We said that if scabs are working a ship and

union men discharge in another port the boat so loaded, then those union

men are strike breakers, since they help the capitalist in question to

carry on his business. That if union seamen man a boat discharged by

scabs, these union seamen or firemen are by the same reason

strike-breakers, as also are the railwaymen 


---

p.322


 or carters who

assist in transporting the goods handled by the scabs for the capitalist

who is fighting his men or women. In other words, we appealed to the

collective soul of the workers against the collective hatred of the

capitalist.


We asked for no more than the logical development

of that idea of working class unity, that the working class of Britain

should help us to prevent the Dublin capitalists carrying on their

business without us. We asked for the isolation of the capitalists of

Dublin, and for answer the leaders of the British labour movement

proceeded calmly to isolate the working class of Dublin. As an answer to

those who supported our request for the isolation of Dublin we were told

that a much better plan would be to increase the subsidies to enable us

to increase strike pay. As soon as this argument had served its purpose,

the subsidies fell off, and the ‘Dublin Fund’ grew smaller and

smaller as if by a pre-arranged plan. We had rejected the last terms

offered by the employers on the strength of this talk of increased

supplies, and as soon as that last attempt at settlement thus fell

through, the supplies gradually froze up instead of being increased as

we had been promised.[16](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note016.html'))


In addition to this the National Union of

Railwaymen, whilst in attendance at the Special Conference in London on

9th December, had actually in their

pockets the arrangements for the re-starting of work on the London and

North-Western boat at the North Wall of Dublin, and in the train

returning to Dublin the day after the Conference, we read of the line

being re-opened. No vote was taken of the men on strike; they were

simply ordered back to work by their officials and told that if they did

not return, their strike pay would be stopped. The Seamen's and

Firemen's Union men in Dublin were next ordered to man the boats of the

Head Line of steamers, then being discharged by free labourers supplied

by the Shipping Federation. In both Dublin and Belfast the members

refused, and they were then informed that union men would be brought 


---

p.323


 from Great Britain to take their places. Union men to be

brought from Britain to take the place of members of the same union who

refused to desert their brothers of the Irish Transport and General

Workers' Union. We were attempting to hold up Guinness' porter. A

consignment was sent to Sligo for shipment there. The local Irish

Transport and General Workers' Union official wired me for instructions.

I wired to hold it up; his men obeyed, and it was removed from Sligo,

railed to Derry, and there put on board by members of Mr. James Sexton's

National Union of Dockers on ships manned by members of Mr. Havelock

Wilson's National Union of Seamen and discharged in Liverpool by members

of Mr. James Sexton's Union. Whilst the City of Dublin Steam Packet

Company was still insisting upon carrying the goods of our worst enemy,

Jacob's (who is still enforcing the agreement denounced by Sir Geo.

Askwith) the members of the Seamen and Firemen's Union were ordered to

sign on in their boats, although our men were still on strike. We were

informed by Mr. Joe Houghton of the Scottish Dockers that his union

would not hold up any boat for us unless joint action was taken by the

National Transport Workers' Federation. As on a previous occasion, his

members at Ayr had worked coal boats belonging to a Belfast firm that

was making war upon the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, we

do not blame Joe very much. He had been disobeyed at Ayr—perhaps

he was coerced in Glasgow.


But why go on? Sufficient to say that

the working class unity of the first days of the Dublin fight was

sacrificed in the interests of sectional officialism. The officials

failed to grasp the opportunity offered to them to make a permanent

reality of the union of working class forces brought into being by the

spectacle of rebellion, martyrdom and misery exhibited by the workers of

Dublin. All England and Scotland rose to it; working class officialdom

and working class rank and file alike responded to the call of

inspiration; it would have raised us 


---

p.324


 all upward and onward

towards our common emancipation. But sectionalism, intrigues and

old-time jealousies damned us in the hour of victory, and officialdom

was the first to fall to the tempter.


And so we Irish workers

must go down into Hell, bow our backs to the lash of the slave driver,

let our hearts be seared by the iron of his hatred, and instead of the

sacramental wafer of brotherhood and common sacrifice, eat the dust of

defeat and betrayal.

A LESSON FROM DUBLIN
--------------------


Some time ago I reprinted in

 Forward an extract from an article I had contributed to

the Irish Review defending and expounding the idea of the

sympathetic strike.[18](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note018.html')) That was at the beginning of the

Dublin struggle. Now, the members of the Irish Transport and General

Workers' Union who have returned to work in Dublin have done so after

signing an agreement to handle all classes of goods, that is to say, to

renounce for the time the idea and practice of the sympathetic

strike.


This, by the way, is the only agreement yet signed by

members of that union. In those firms which still insist upon the former

Employers' Agreement banning the Irish Transport and General Workers'

Union the strike or lock-out is still in active operation.


But

the question arises: what reason is to be derived from our experience of

the sympathetic strike in Dublin? What lesson can be learned from a cool

and reasoned study of our struggle?


Let me repeat the essence of

the article alluded to as an explanation of the nature of the

sympathetic strike. It pointed out that we in Dublin had realised that

the capitalist cannot be successfully fought upon the industrial field

unless we recognise that all classes of workers should recognise their

common interests, that such recognition implied that an employer engaged

in a struggle with his workpeople should be made taboo or tainted, that

no other workers should co-operate in helping to keep his business

growing, that no goods coming from his works should be handled by

organised workers, and no goods going to his works should be conveyed by

organised workers. That he should, in effect, be put outside the pale of

civilisation, and communication with him should be regarded as being as

deadly a crime as correspondence with an enemy in war time. I tried to

illustrate this by citing examples of social warfare conducted on

similar lines in the past by various societies and classes.


It

may then be asked: how far has the Dublin experience 


---

p.326




justified or failed to justify those who, like myself, contended for the

practicability of this policy? We have been forced in Dublin to

abandon the policy temporarily because other unions whose co-operation

was necessary had not adopted a similar policy. It was not practicable

to enforce the policy of tainted goods in Dublin whilst the goods so

held up could be transported from other ports and handled across channel

by other unions. The executives of other unions failing to sanction the

co-operation of their members, the enforcement of this policy became an

impossibility. Hence I submit that the main difficulty in the way of the

success of this policy is in the multiplicity of unions and

executives. Every union not immediately engaged in the conflict is a

union whose material interests—looked at from a narrowly selfish

point of view—are opposed to being drawn into the struggle.

Therefore, every executive naturally aligns itself in opposition to the

policy of a sympathetic strike, except when it is its own union that is

immediately concerned. When it is one of the principals in the fight

then each union becomes as enthusiastically in favour of the sympathetic

strike as it formerly was against it. We have seen this exemplified

recently in London in the cases of the Coalmen's strike and the London

Builders' lock-out. In fact every union that nowadays becomes involved

in a strike appeals to sympathetic action immediately, even after

condemning its theory when at peace. It is no use pointing out the

inconsistency of such action; it is merely a case of following the

immediate material interests of their union, instead of the broader

material and moral welfare of their class. But when we recognise this

ugly fact, what lesson ought we to derive from it?


We ought, I

think, to learn that the first duty of the militant worker to-day is to

work for industrial unionism in some form. To work for the abolition

or merging of all these unions that now divide our energies instead of

concentrating them—and for the abolition of all those executives

whose measure of 


---

p.327


 success is the balance sheet of their

union, instead of the power of their class. The doctrine of ‘tainted

goods’ is vitally necessary for the salvation of labour upon the

industrial field, but its enforcement is not possible as long as

labour is split up by unions whose executives look upon fellow workers

in conflict with dread as possible sources of depletion of their

treasuries. Be it remembered that it is scarcely humanly possible that

these executives should act otherwise if the consciousness of class

solidarity has not entered into the minds and hearts of their

membership; but if and when it has so entered, then a bigoted

conservatism based upon old traditional methods of action becomes a

crime against the progress of the species.


This is to my mind the

lesson of Dublin. Industrial unionism, the amalgamation of all forces

of labour into one union, capable of concentrating all forces upon any

one issue or in any one fight, can alone fight industrially as the

present development and organisation of capital requires that labour

should fight. This will not be accomplished in a day, nor in a year, but

should be definitely aimed at, no matter how long may be the period of

its accomplishment.


The organisation of all workers in any one

industry into a union covering that entire industry, and the linking up

of all such unions under one head is a different thing from the mere

amalgamation of certain unions. But whilst not necessarily antagonistic,

it is certainly more in the line of industrial development, and more

effective in the day of conflict.


The name also helps to retrieve

the workers' movement from the unnatural alliance with mere

anti-politicalism so unfortunately and unnecessarily introduced as a

fresh dividing issue at this juncture when all our minds ought to be set

upon unity.

THE

LENTEN PASTORALS—A CHALLENGE
---------------------------------


A year ago at the meeting

of the Maynooth Union a paper was read on ‘Syndicalism’ which

attracted widespread attention at the time because of the sympathetic

attitude towards organised Labour taken up by the reverend author of the

paper in question, and because the same sympathetic note was struck by

most of the speakers who took part in the discussion following the

reading of the paper. We were amongst the number of writers to the press

who commented upon this phenomenon, and in our press, the Irish

Worker, we emphasised the fact that in the main the speakers who

gave this turn to the discussion seemed to represent the younger

clergy—the younger clergy who had been students while the modern

labour movement was influencing the literature and thought of the

world.[19](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note019.html')) Now

to-day we are confronted with another phenomena upon a somewhat similar

field. The united Irish Hierarchy have issued to the faithful in Ireland

a joint Pastoral upon the labour question in the light of the Dublin

dispute.


As representing the union most actively involved in

that dispute, we take it that it will be thought no impertinence or

undue self-importance on our part if we avail ourselves now of the

opportunity to comment upon the Pastoral from the standpoint of labour,

and to place before our readers the construction we place upon the

events with which that Pastoral deals. We are workers. And we speak for

the class to which we belong.


As workers then*,* we feel that we have no apology to offer for our share

in the recent dispute. The Pastoral admits that it is the right, nay,

that it is the duty of the workers to combine for their own advancement;

it admits that there will always be the possibility of disagreement,

leading to conflict even 


---

p.329


 when the best intentions exist

upon both sides; it contends that against such possibilities of strife

the best remedy in Ireland is a strong Irish Trades Union, and impresses

upon all the desirability of a Conciliation Board to obviate the dangers

of industrial war. Well, then, we submit that on all these

points—and they are the cardinal points of the Pastoral—our

action in the past has been entirely upon the lines suggested. We found

the workers disorganised, and we proceeded to organise them. We taught

them to use their organisation for their own moral and material

advancement, and as a result have endued them with a higher sense of the

dignity of manhood and womanhood, and weaned them from their former

habits of dissipation and recklessness. Against the possibility, the

certainty of disagreements between employers and employed when the

latter sought for relief from intolerable burdens of toil and low wagery

we established an Irish trade union, absolutely independent of British

control or influence, and appealing solely to the spirit of

self-reliance we sought to inculcate in the Irish working class.


And finally, in order to prepare a way of escape out of the strife

that might follow upon hot-headedness on the part of employers or upon

our own part, we proposed in the Dublin Trades Council and in our own

press the establishment of Conciliation Boards for the prevention, or

if that failed, for the settlement of labour disputes. In other words,

our activity has been entirely upon the lines indicated in the Pastoral

as being the proper lines to follow in our position. If, then, our

activity did not bring peace but a sword the fault lies with those who

prefer to take the sword rather than suffer the loss of any portion of

the profits and domination they lusted for, and had so long enjoyed at

the cost of the suffering and damnation of so many thousands of our

class. From beginning to end of the dispute—if it can be said to

have ended—we have offered to meet and to discuss with our

opponents; from beginning 


---

p.330


 to end our opponents have refused

to meet and discuss directly with us, even in the two abortive

Conferences, insisting upon keeping the two directly interested bodies

from getting into friendly discussion. *We would most respectfully

challenge the Hierarchy to name any one point of importance that we

refused to concede, which they, had they been in our place, would have

conceded, to our opponents*. They cannot name one and be true to the

position they take up in their Lenten Pastoral.


It is of little

practical value in this rough work-a-day world of ours to enunciate

principles, however sublime, and to refuse to take into account the very

imperfect human material with which those principles have to deal. We

had and have to deal with a set of employers the most heartless and the

most ignorantly selfish in Christendom—employers too lazy to adapt

themselves to modern methods of business and seeking by fiendish

undercutting of wages to meet the legitimate competition of employers

elsewhere who do use modern methods and adopt modern business ideas.

In any large centre elsewhere the manager who persisted in using the

antiquated methods and the slipshod lack of system that characterises

the Dublin employers as a whole would be fired out of his job quicker

than he could draw his first week's salary. But up to the present the

constantly available supply of cheap labour has prevented the

development of up-to-date methods of business in Dublin, and when the

Irish Transport and General Workers' Trade Union began to push up the

rate of wages and to destroy the supply of cheap labour, instead of the

Dublin employers moving with the times and changing their wasteful

methods accordingly their only thought was to destroy the union, and to

remain in the unprogressive, slovenly, unenterprising state which now

and in the past has excited the laughter of every observant visitor.


In any other city an attempt to raise the wages of tramway-men from

the low standard at which they were in Dublin would not have caused a

lock-out. The wages would have 


---

p.331


 been raised, and the

managing director would have sought by cheaper fares and other

attractions, to attract greater receipts to compensate for greater outlays. It is now well-established that cheaper fares by tram or rail or

steamer mean greater numbers travelling and hence greater receipts.


But in Dublin such a thing was impossible. An increase of wages was

not met by a development of enterprise, no, but the suggestion of an

increase was met with an outburst of eighteenth century barbarity and a

perfect carnival of ferocity towards labour. This attitude of Mr.

William Martin Murphy is typical of the whole class in Dublin to which

he belongs. Like the Bourbons ‘they learn nothing and they forget

nothing’. The whole world is advancing around them, labour is

everywhere stirring out of the depths of subjection and advancing upward

to the heights of citizenship and towards the responsibilities of

freedom. But all this shaking up of old systems of thought, all this

stirring into life of the dormant germs of social consciousness

amongst our long oppressed people leaves them absolutely untouched. As

the tiger reared upon flesh can never lose his craving for that food, so

the Dublin employer reared as employer upon the flesh and blood of cheap

labour can never wholly relinquish, and in most cases cannot even

partially relinquish, his lust after cheapness in the labour he

exploits. The highest industrial authorities in the world declare that

cheap labour never pays in the end; the Dublin employers declare that

unless they can have a plentiful supply of cheap and helpless labour,

civilisation's hopes in Ireland are for ever doomed. The ineffective

pigmies of capitalist Dublin oppose their ridiculous theories to the

world-wide experience of the giants of international capitalism.


In face of this the beautiful theories of the Lenten Pastorals seem

rather weak and ineffective. The whole record of the Dublin master class

has been marked by a contemptuous and cynical disregard for every

principle of social conduct set forth by his Holiness Pope Pius X, or

his Holiness Pope Leo XIII. Not an independent professional man, not an

unselfish literary man or woman of genius, not a clergyman of any

denomination, not an important public servant who investigated the

merits of the dispute all during our long agony, failed to acknowledge

finally the justice of our cause or to be won to admiration by the

patient suffering and steadfast adherence to an ideal exhibited by the

Dublin workers. Be it remembered that even his Grace the Archbishop of

Dublin publicly expressed his agreement with the proposals for a

settlement which we put forward. On the first occasion the employers met

his prayer for peace by importing British scabs; on the second, when he

blessed our peace proposals on the eve of Christmas, they contemptuously

refused even to look at them. Again we ask, *we challenge, the

Hierarchy to name the point of importance which we refused to concede

which they, were they in our place, would have conceded to our

opponents*.


Let it be at once understood that the strictures

upon socialism and syndicalism embodied in the Pastorals leave us

unmoved. As complete systems of thought these two principles do not

exist, whatever some extremists may say or imagine. As lines of action

they do exist, and their influence is wholly beneficial. It is only when

taken as offering a completely worked-out system of thought capable of

dictating human conduct in all possible phases, and hence governing

human morals accordingly, that either of them came under the strictures

of theologians with any degree of justification. But in their present

stage in the labour movement, viz., as indicating lines of activity in

the industrial and political world—the only stage in which they

are ever likely to be popular or useful in Ireland—the most

consistent socialist or syndicalist may be as Catholic as the Pope if he

is so minded.


And it may help the learned authors of the Lenten

Pastoral to a becoming frame of mind that the recent exposure of the 


---

p.333


 soul-corrupting and murderous tenements in which this

capitalistic system condemned so many thousands of their and our

co-religionists to rot and suffer and die was not due to any crusading

against slums or the things that make for and maintain slums on the part

of either Hierarchy or of the parochial clergy, but was solely due to

the fierce revolt of the victims, and the reckless campaigning of their

leaders. If and when a purified Dublin arises, with clean streets,

healthy homes and happy citizens, it will surely be remembered that

whatever its foundations may be in lime, mortar or brick, its real

foundations were the hunger, suffering and martyrdom even unto death of

the working class men, women and girls of Dublin; that their hunger,

suffering and martyrdom by challenging the conscience of the civilised

world laid the foundation of that sweeter, happier city of which we and

Ireland shall yet be proud.[20](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note020.html'))

CHANGES
-------


Reading of the May Day celebrations of the past week brought back to

my mind in a very vivid fashion a realisation of the changes that have

taken place in socialist propaganda since the inauguration of Labour Day

in these countries.


In the earlier period the question of an

eight hour working day was to a large extent a test question on all the

May Day Committees, as indeed it also was in the Trade Union Congresses

of that time. Those who were old-time trade unionists and adherents of

the liberal or tory parties stood out for May Day resolutions, demanding

simply an ‘eight hour working day’, whilst those who were of the

newer school and were inclined to socialistic ideas quite as vehemently

demanded that the wording of the resolution should call for a

‘legislative’ or ‘legal eight hour day’. One could indeed

tell roughly what proportion the antagonistic school of socialists or

non-socialists bore upon any such committee by a study of the wording of

the resolution, and tracing the emphasis or lack of emphasis given to

the call for legislative action.


The same fight was being fought

out in all the Trade Unions, Trade Councils, and Trade Congresses. The

question of legislative action to restrict or otherwise regulate the

hours of labour divided the sheep from the goats all over the country.

Many men, now active propagandists of the socialist cause, were first

launched upon that path by finding themselves as supporters of

legislative restriction denounced as socialists by the old school of

individualist trade unionists, and being thus thrown into the arms of

socialists developed a sympathetic attitude towards their general

teaching.


The more recent recruits to the socialist ranks can

scarcely 


---

p.336


 realise what the position of the movement was at

that time when he reads or hears that the passing of a resolution at the

British Trade Congress calling for a ‘legal’ eight hours working

day was hailed by the socialist propagandists of that period as a great

socialist victory. Yet so it was. In the ordinary outdoor and indoor

socialist propaganda, the same mental attitude was dominant. If it were

now possible to examine the socialist speeches of that period we would

find that an inordinately large proportion of time was given up in them

to a belittling of industrial action and to what was practically an

exaggeration of the ease and facility with which the working class could

achieve its rights at the ballot-box.


This belittling of

industrial action and denial of its possibilities formed the main theme

of the speeches of so many socialist orators that it is more than

possible that thousands of good earnest trade unionists were estranged

from a friendly examination of the socialist cause by what they felt to

be something like insidious attacks upon working-class organisation. The

socialist movement at the time was in a nebulous, chaotic state, not

only with regard to its organised expression, but also with regard to

its growing tactics, and the tendency was for all its speakers to

exploit that which for the time being secured the largest audience.

Perhaps that is the tendency still. But what I am endeavouring to convey

is that consideration of the means towards the end, the tactics to be

followed in realising the consummation aimed at formed but a small part

of socialist study. Beyond a general affirmation of a belief in

‘common ownership’, and in political action as the means of

realising that common ownership, few speakers dared to venture. In

consequence, the demand for political action became the creed of the

socialist, and in the endeavour to make the propaganda serve the general

purpose of advancing the demand for political action, that demand

constantly tended to overshadow the general principle of the socialist

movement 


---

p.337


 itself. This stage of socialist propaganda in

Great Britain may be said to have reached its highest point in the

General Election of 1906, which resulted in the return of a large number

of labour members to Parliament, and the partial reversal of the Taff

Vale Decision.[21](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note021.html'))


With that victory the propaganda seemed to

undergo a radical change. Whether it was because the workers had built

too high hopes upon the advent of such a limited number of labour men

into the House of Commons, or because the men elected were destitute of

the courage and initiative necessary for their position, or from both

causes combined, or from neither, I do not presume to say; but certain

it is that there was for a long period a falling off of enthusiasm for

the political side of socialism. Perhaps it would be better to say that

there began to dawn a belief that socialism had really another side, and

that a man's belief in the efficacy of legislation was not a real test

of the sincerity of his socialist convictions. Then there came the

industrial upheaval of 1911, with its series of brilliant victories won

by labour upon the industrial battlefield, and the growth of an opinion

among socialists totally adverse to political action. For a considerable

period this anti-political idea made headway, and we saw its influence

making itself felt all over the socialist world. It is the very

antithesis of the opinion I have described as being considered formerly

as a true standard by which a socialist might be judged, yet no one

would to-day argue that because a man held such ideas he could not

therefore be rightly classed as a socialist. In the older days we would

have at once branded such a man as an anarchist, to-day we are not so

sure of his classification. That in itself is a wonderful change in the

attitude of the socialist towards political action.


Because of

the slight reverses sustained at a uniform high level of excitement

and victory, there is now in many quarters a recrudescence of the older

attitude towards industrial battlings. 


---

p.338


 Leaders in plenty,

even some engaged in industrial work, are to be found decrying strikes

and deprecating all restlessness and rebellion which does not express

itself at the ballot box. In some quarters we can even trace what looks

suspiciously like a desire to gloat over industrial defeats and to welcome them as evidences of the futility of industrial action, and the

super-excellence of politics.


Now having observed this movement

around the clock, and observed it from the standpoint of one caught

amongst the wheels, I am inclined to ask all and sundry amongst our

comrades if there is any necessity for this presumption of antagonism

between the industrialist and the political advocate of socialism. I

cannot see any. I believe that such supposed necessity only exists in

the minds of the mere theorists or doctrinaires. The practical fighter

in the work-a-day world makes no such distinction. He fights, and he

votes; he votes and he fights. He may not always, he does not always,

vote right; nor yet does he always fight when and as he should. But I do

not see that his failure to vote right is to be construed into a reason

for advising him not to vote at all; nor yet why a failure to strike

properly should be used as a gibe at the strike weapon, and a reason for

advising him to place his whole reliance upon votes.


I am glad of

the experience of the past few years. I am glad that the extremely

doctrinaire political attitude towards strikes received a check, and

that that check came straight out of the practical experience of the

workers in ship, shore, shop and railway. I am glad that the equally

doctrinaire attitude of the anti-political people has failed to sweep

the working class off its feet. And I trust that out of this experience

will be born wisdom, and that such wisdom will enable us to develop a

working class action which will combine the political and industrial

activities of the workers on militant and aggressive lines.




---

p.339


The development of the power of the modern state should

teach us that the mere right to vote will not protect the workers unless

they have a strong economic organisation behind them; that the

nationalisation or municipalisation of industries but changes the form

of the workers' servitude whilst leaving its essence unimpaired; and

that in the long run the class in control of the economic forces of the

nation will be able to dominate and direct its political powers.


On the other hand, that very development also teaches us that until

the workers have perfected their economic power sufficiently to control

the economic forces*,* the class actually

in control will most relentlessly and scientifically use their political

powers to hamper, penalise and if possible destroy the activities of the

workers' organisation, and thus prevent the creation of a force

sufficient for their suppression.


My reading of history tells me

that in all great social changes the revolutionary class always fails

of success until it is able to do the work of the class it seeks to

destroy, and to do it more efficiently. And when it has so perfected

itself that it is able to perform this work, neither gods nor men can

stop its onward march to victory. In other words, a new social order

cannot supplant the old until it has its own organisation ready to

take its place. Within the social order of capitalism I can see no

possibility of building up a new economic organisation fit for the work

of superseding the old on socialist lines, except that new order be

built upon the lines of the industries that capitalism itself has

perfected. Therefore I am heart and soul an industrial unionist. But

because I know that the capitalist class is alert and unscrupulous in

its use of power, I do not propose to leave it the uncontested use of

the powers of the state. And because I realise that human nature is a

wonderful thing, that the soul of man gives expression to strange and

complex phenomena, and that no man knows what powers or possibilities

for good or evil lie in humanity, I try to preserve my receptivity

towards

 all new ideas, my tolerance towards all

manifestations of social activity.

LABOUR IN THE NEW IRISH PARLIAMENT
----------------------------------


What is to be the

position of labour in the first Irish Parliament? To judge by the

written opinion of many of our friends we would be inclined to believe

that the representation of labour in that Parliament would be a

certainty, and that it would not be a mere nominal representation, but

rather on a large, and as one writer has said, a dominating scale. If

this were so, then we might truly felicitate the labour movement in

Ireland upon its marvellous progress, and felicitate the Irish working

class upon the keenness of their insight and the alertness of their

intelligence.


Writing as one who has a close inside knowledge of

the Irish labour movement, and also as one who does believe in the

keen political insight of the Irish workers as a whole, I yet feel

constrained to warn the readers of Forward that the real

outlook in Ireland is not by any means so rosy and full of immediate

promise as our sanguine friends are prone to believe. It is somewhat of

an uncertainty whether labour will be represented in the first Irish

Parliament at all.


There are many reasons why this is an

uncertainty. One of the greatest is the financial reason. Most people

are of the opinion that the Irish Parliament will at least not be a

retrograde institution, or elected upon a franchise or after a method

held elsewhere in these islands to be antiquated. That any forward

step taken elsewhere will at least be presumed for the benefit of the

Irish democracy. It is therefore somewhat of a shock to many to learn

that under the new Home Rule Constitution, no provision is made for

payment of members of Parliament but it is left to be dealt with by

the new Irish legislature. Thus in the first Irish Parliament the

members will be unpaid, and as the chief concern of that Parliament will

be that of finding 


---

p.342


 the ways and means to keep itself

financially afloat, and to soothe the susceptibilities of its critics,

there is more than a strong probability that the members will remain

unpaid in future legislatures also. Had the present Government or the

present labour party in the House of Commons done what the Irish workers

had a right to expect that they should do, the chances of labour

representation in the Irish Parliament would have been immensely

increased by making provision for the maintenance of Irish labour

members, and thus making smoother the path of the Irish labour party.

But no such provision was made.


The present Home Rule party had

and have no desire to see labour in the Irish Parliament represented by

an independent party of workers. Representing as they do the capitalist

class, the publicans, and the gombeen men or money-lenders of rural

Ireland as well as the lowest class of slum landlords in the cities,

they dread as they dread retribution, the advent of men or women with

ideas of regeneration and social emancipation for Ireland. They do not

want anything that might help the victims of their friends and relatives

to put a legislative curb to their slave-driving and sweating. Of course

that is not the reason they alleged. Oh, no! They alleged that they

‘considered that the Irish Parliament should have control over its own

finance, and they objected to the English Parliament limiting its powers

in advance’. And of course the British labour party swallowed this

yarn, oblivious of the fact that the English Parliament was limiting the

powers of the Irish Parliament in a score of ridiculous and even fatally

harmful ways with the full consent of their Home Rule colleagues, and

that it was only when it came to increasing the power of the Irish

democracy that the Home Rule party objected to the interference of the

English Parliament.


An indication by the British labour party

that they meant to insist upon payment of members being incorporated in

the 


---

p.343


 Home Rule constitution, as a principle that public

services should be paid for by the public, would have made the

situations infinitely easier for Irish labour, but no such indication

was forthcoming.


In every Home Rule speech the precedent of the

British colonies is cited as an argument in favour of the measure, but

the democratic spirit in which the colonial constitutions are framed was

deliberately shut out by the framers of the Home Rule Bill. Whereas the

colonial constitutions aim at giving power to the democracy, the Home

Rule constitution aims at restricting the power of the democracy. And

now there are to be still further attempts at restriction and divisions,

in order to please the Bourbons of Ulster, who learn nothing and forget

nothing.


Added to this hampering restriction upon the Irish

democracy's choice of elected members, there is the fact that there is

yet no fund available with which Irish labour constituencies can be

contested. Resolutions are all very well, and class feeling is an

excellent thing, but in the electoral world neither of these can

manifest themselves without the sinews of war. Now if there is one thing

the Irish labour movement is at present wanting in, it is finance for

electoral contests. The Dublin labour party fight all municipal and

other local contests, as does every other district of nationalist

Ireland where the new influence is making itself felt, but to do even

that is a severe strain upon their resources.


That they could

with their present limited resources grapple with the infinitely greater

cost of Parliamentary elections is almost unthinkable. In the north the

trade unions are for the most part content to play the orange game, and

are as bodies merely passive allies of the capitalist-landlord faction

in warring upon the progressive movement.


Thus the imminence of

the Home Rule elections brings into greater prominence the need for

some kind of action being taken in Ireland and elsewhere 


---

p.344


 to

equip the labour movement with the necessary funds to assault some of

the seats in the Home Rule Parliament. . ..


Without the invigorating presence of an alert and independent labour

party in its midst the Irish House of Commons will be for years a most

reactionary and anti-democratic assembly, setting a bad example to

Tories and reactionists everywhere. It will be obsessed with the idea of

placating the reactionary elements in Ulster, and thus of justifying

itself against their aspersions. What this means you can best understand

when you realise that Ulster is the most capitalist part of Ireland,

that the game will be to represent every bit of labour legislation which

menaces capitalist profits as an attack upon the industries of Ulster,

and that the fear of this cry will cause the new Irish Government, and

every non-labour element in Parliament, to oppose all social

legislation. Only a strong and determined labour group, with a true

revolutionary outlook, will be able to withstand this cry, force

forward progressive legislation and combat reactionary measures.


The dice are heavily loaded against us in Ireland. They are loaded by

the evil traditions of the past, by the cowardice of many working class

elements in the north especially, by the awful poverty of the country,

by the ignorant obstinacy of the capitalist class, by sectarian

animosities, by unscrupulous politicians, by a lying press.


We

can only hope to carry our flag to victory by securing the aid of all

those workers everywhere who desire to see an effective force carrying

the green flag of an Irish regiment whilst unconditionally under the red

flag of the proletarian army.

 DISTURBED DUBLIN
-----------------


 DISTURBED DUBLIN is the title of a book just published

in the interests of the Dublin employers, and with the name of Arnold

Wright upon its title page as author. The purpose of this book is to

present to the reading public as colourable a presentation as possible

of the events from the employers' point of view of the great dispute of

1913-14. We are not saying so because this book is antagonistic to the

cause of labour, but we say so because from the very first paragraph of

the preface to the last sentence of the volume itself this bias against

labour is so pronounced that the idea that it found its inspiration in

the councils of the employers springs at once to the mind of the

thoughtful reader. For instance,

let us quote from the second sentence of the preface, where the author

describes the result of the employers' conspiracy as: 
> 
> The ignominious defeat of the attempt to establish a peculiarly
> 
> pernicious form of Syndicalism on Irish soil.
> 
> 
> 




This, one must admit, is a good start for an ‘impartial’

history, and the same spirit is in evidence all through the book. In

this attempt to present a literary justification for the employers the

author does not scruple to distort facts, and even to state deliberate

untruths.


One such case will serve as a sample. In the early part

of 1913 the Belfast Branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers

Union secured an agreement with several shipping firms in that city

bringing the wages of their labourers up to the level of the men

employed by the same firms on the docks at Dublin. One of the firms so

affected was the Clyde Shipping Company. After a short time the union

officials found that 


---

p.347


 the foreman in charge of the London

boat of that firm in Belfast was apparently systematically giving

preference to non-union men. Several ineffective attempts having been

made to check this*,* the Belfast officials

at last called their men off, and refused to allow them to work with

non-union men. This step was only taken in obedience to extreme pressure

from the men themselves. The boat upon which this strike took place was

the *Sanda*, and had only a part cargo for Belfast, the

remainder being consigned to Dublin. When the boat left Belfast the

union officials in that city wired to headquarters in Dublin to ‘hold

up’ the boat. This was at first done, but after a few hours delay

the boat was worked by the Dublin members, their officials having

brought pressure to bear on the Belfast secretary to allow the cargo to

be discharged in order to keep the contract they had made in Dublin with

the Clyde company. Thus, as it afterwards transpired, the Dublin

officials practically sacrificed their own members in Belfast, and

worked a boat against which their own members were on strike, in order

to keep their agreement with the Clyde Shipping Company, and in hopes

that the matter would be settled by friendly discussion. It was settled

by friendly discussion, but the spectacle of the Dublin members out of

loyalty to an agreement working a boat struck by their fellow members in

Belfast was so unexpected and bewildering that some two hundred members

were lost to the union in the latter city as a consequence.


Now

here is how this ‘impartial’ author tells the story. Page 108:


> 
> Some men who were working on a vessel called the
> 
> *Sandow*, belonging to the Clyde Shipping Company, without a
> 
> moment's notice ceased work. On inquiry by Mr. Young it was found that
> 
> the grievance was that the men were not receiving such large wages as
> 
> the company's employees in Belfast. This, it was represented, was the
> 
> more important 
> 
> 
> ---
> 
> p.348
> 
> 
>  matter, as there existed in the northern
> 
> port a union which was inimical to Mr. Larkin, and which he regarded
> 
> with a mutual feeling of aversion.
> 
> 
> 




Now observe

all the misstatements in those three sentences.


First: The wrong

name of the vessel; showing a most slipshod inaccuracy of

investigation.


Second: The statement that the Dublin men were

receiving lower wages than the Belfast men, whereas the fact was that

the Belfast men had only recently joined the union in an endeavour to

raise their wages to the level of Dublin.


Third: The allegation

that the union in the northern port which had established the wages

alleged to be higher than those of Dublin was a union inimical to Mr.

Larkin. In reality it was, and is, a branch of the union of which Mr.

Larkin was and is General Secretary.


Thus in the small compass of

nine printed lines we find one mistake and two deliberate lies. Observe

that it is entirely unthinkable that this so-called investigator could

of his own initiative have invented those lies. They must have been

supplied to him by the employers, and, like the good investigator that

he was, he never bothered himself to check their account by any such

simple expedient as a trip to Liberty Hall, or a question put personally

to any of the dockers involved in that dispute. The inference is that he

did not do it, because he did not dare to do it. He was brought over

here by the employers to do the employers' work, and it must be said of

him that he faithfully, if clumsily, tried to earn his money.


As we have said, the story of that incident is a sample of the

treatment meted out to the labourer by the author in every chapter in

the book. One feels like congratulating the real literary men of Dublin

that the employers could not trust one of them to be sufficiently blind

to facts as to present a case that would suit the employers. A stranger,

without any knowledge 


---

p.349


 of Dublin people, without any insight

into the terrible struggle life involves to a Dublin worker, without any

appreciation of the finer elements of character which the Dublin

toiler has preserved in spite of the hell of poverty and misery in which

he or she was born and reared, without any grasp of the blended squalor

and heroism, pride and abasement that environment has woven into the

Dublin character, and absolutely blind and deaf to all knowledge of the

countless cross-currents, interests and traditions that played their

part in moulding and shaping that historic struggle—it is only

such a fatuously ignorant stranger that the employers of Dublin could

count upon to describe that struggle as they wanted it described.


The achievement of the employers is written of as if the book was

dealing with the struggle of a puny David against a mighty Goliath, the

employers being David and Jim Larkin the giant Goliath. No epic story of

heroism that was ever written could surpass in admiring sentences the

description of the employers' battle against the working men and women

as this hack writer tells it.


Told by a labour writer, or even

told by one of those literary men who, although not of the manual labour

ranks stood so grandly by the workers during that titanic struggle, the

story would indeed read like an epic, but it would be an epic of which

the heroes and heroines were the humble men and women who went out in

the street to suffer and starve rather than surrender their right to

combine as they chose for the uplifting of their class. Some day that

story will be written from that standpoint, meanwhile let us briefly

cast up the elements out of which that story will be composed.


It

must tell how four hundred Dublin employers covenanted together, and

pledged each other by solemn vows, and by still more binding financial

pledges, that there would be no more resumption of work in Dublin until

the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union was wiped off the map.

How they 


---

p.350


 agreed upon a document to be forced upon all

workers that they would neither join nor help that union. How they had

all the press of every shade of politics and religion upon their side.

How they obtained beforehand the promise of swift and relentless use

of Government forces, of batons, bullets, and jails to destroy the

resistance of the workers. How that promise was faithfully kept by the

Government. How they were able to override the law, and to fill the

prisons with old and young, men and women, boys and girls, who attempted

to exercise the picketing rights guaranteed to them by British law. How

they instituted a reign of terror in which the lives of every worker was

at the mercy of every callous brute in the uniform of a policeman or the

vocation of a scab. How starvation was sent into the homes of

thousands of the poor, until their lives were shortened by the

sufferings enforced. How one bright young girl was shot, two honest

workers batoned to death, and one other destroyed in his bright manhood

by the hirelings of the Government. How the domestic privacy of the poor

was violated, their poor household treasures ruthlessly smashed and the

most sacred feelings of womanhood outraged by hordes of drunken

policemen. And how through all this long-drawn-out agony every agency of

every organised political, journalistic, social or religious kind in

Ireland, not directly controlled by labour, joined in one great unanimous chorus in vilification of the sufferers, and in praise of their

oppressors.


When that story is written by a man or woman with

an honest heart, and with a sympathetic insight into the travail of the

poor, it will be a record of which Ireland may well be proud. It will

tell of how the old women and young girls, long crushed and enslaved,

dared to risk all, even life itself, in the struggle to make life more

tolerable, more free of the grinding tyranny of the soulless Dublin

employers. It will tell of how, like an inspiration, there came to those

Irish women and girls the thought that no free nation could be reared

which 


---

p.351


 tolerated the enslavement of its daughters to the

worst forms of wage-slavery, and how in the glow of that inspiration

they arose from their seats in the workshop or factory, and went out to

suffer and struggle along with their men. It will tell of how the

general labourers, the men upon whose crushed lives is built the fair

fabric of civilisation, from whose squalid tenements the sweet-smelling

flowers of capitalist culture derive their aroma, by whose horny hands

and mangled bodies are bought the ease and safety of a class that hates

and despises them, by whose ignorance their masters purchase their

knowledge—it will tell how these labourers dared to straighten

their bent backs, and looking in the faces of their rulers and employers

dared to express the will to be free. And it will tell how that

spectacle of the slave of the underworld looking his masters in the face

without terror, and fearlessly proclaiming the kinship and unity of

all with each and each with all, how that spectacle caught the

imagination of all unselfish souls so that the artisan took his place

also in the place of conflict and danger, and the men and women of

genius, the artistic and the literati, hastened to honour and serve

those humble workers whom all had hitherto despised and scorned.


And that story will tell how, despite the wealth and the power of the

masters, despite jails and batons, despite starvation and death, victory

was within sight for the Dublin workers, and only eluded their grasp

because of the failure of a part of their allies to remain keyed up to

the battle pitch. Because others outside their ranks were not able to

realise the grandeur of the opportunity, the sublimity of the issues at

stake.


The battle was a drawn battle. The employers, despite

their Napoleonic plan of campaign, and their more than Napoleonic

ruthlessness and unscrupulous use of foul means were unable to carry on

their business without men and women who remained loyal to their union.

The workers were unable to force the employers to a formal recognition

of the union, and to 


---

p.352


 give preference to organised labour.

From the effects of this drawn battle both sides are still bearing heavy

scars. How deep those scars are none will ever reveal.


But the

working class has lost none of its aggressiveness, none of its confidence, none of its hope in the ultimate triumph. No traitor amongst

the ranks of that class has permanently gained, even materially, by his

or her treachery. The flag of the Irish Transport and General Workers'

Union still flies proudly in the van of the Irish working class, and

that working class still marches proudly and defiantly at the head of

the gathering hosts who stand for a regenerated nation, resting upon a

people industrially free.


Ah, yes, that story of the Dublin

dispute of 1913-14 is meet subject for an epic poem with which some

Irish genius of the future can win an immortality as great as did the

humble fighters who in it fought the battle of labour.

THE DUBLIN LOCK-OUT

AND ITS SEQUEL
-----------------------------------


Do you wish proof of the value of organisation

to the workers, or proof of how impossible it is to destroy organisation

if its members are loyal! I can give you that proof from the records of

our own union.


Let me give you a little bit of

history—history of very recent date. You remember the great

lock-out in Dublin in 1913-14; you remember how the Dublin employers

smarting under the defeats inflicted upon their individual efforts to

keep their workers in slavery, at last resolved to combine in one

gigantic effort to restore the irresponsible reign of the slave drivers

such as existed in Dublin before the advent of the Irish Transport and

General Workers' Union. You will remember how four hundred employers

banded themselves together to destroy us, and pledged their sacred word

of honour that they would wipe that union off the map; that when the

fight was over no man or woman affiliated to us, or friendly to us,

would ever be employed in Dublin. You also remember how they did more

than pledge their honour—the honour of some of them would not

fetch much as a pledge—but they also deposited each a sum of money

in proportion to the number of employees each normally employed, and

that money deposited in the Bank in the name of their association was

to be forfeited, if the depositor came to terms with the union before

his fellows.


Thus strung together in bonds of gold and

self-interest, you might think they were well equipped for beating a lot

of poor workingmen and women with no weapons but their hands, and no

resources but their willingness to suffer for the right. But they were

taking no chances. They laid their plans with the wisdom of the serpent,

and the unscrupulousness of the father of all evil.




---

p.354


Before the lock-out was declared they went to the British Government

in Ireland, to its heads in Dublin Castle, and they said to that

Government, ‘now, look here, we are going to make war upon the Irish

Transport and General Workers' Union, but we believe that we cannot

succeed as we should wish, while peaceful picketing is allowed. We know

it is allowed in England, in Scotland, and in Wales, but we don't want

it allowed in Ireland’. And the Government said: ‘all right,

gentlemen, the law allowing peaceful picketing is only a scrap of paper;

we will tear it up while the fight is on’. The employers said again:

‘good, but these Labour men and women will hold together while they

are able to hold public meetings, and hear their speakers encouraging

them. Could His Majesty's Government not manage to suppress public

meetings, whilst the fight is on’? And the Government answered:

‘Suppress public meetings? Why, of course: the law which permits

public meetings in Ireland is just another scrap of paper, and has been

torn up many a time, and oft; we will tear it up again, so as to help

you in the good work of crushing the Labour movement’.


And

you know, the British Government kept its promise to the employers. All

through that long and bitter struggle, the elementary rights won by

Trade Unionists by a century of sacrifices were denied to us in Dublin,

although freely exercised at the same time in England.


The

locked-out worker who attempted to speak to a scab in order to persuade

him or her not to betray the class they belonged to, was mercilessly set

upon by uniformed bullies, and hauled off to prison, until the prison

was full to overflowing with helpless members of our class. Women and

young girls by the score; good, virtuous, beautiful Irish girls and

women were clubbed and insulted, and thrown into prison by policemen and

magistrates, not one of whom were fit to clean the shoes of the least of

these, our sisters.




---

p.355


Our right of public meeting was

ruthlessly suppressed in the streets of our city, the whole press of the

country was shamelessly engaged in poisoning the minds of the people

against us, every scoundrel who chose was armed to shoot and murder the

workers who stood by their Union.


Two men, James Nolan and John

Byrne, were clubbed to death in the street; one, Byrne of Kingstown,

suffered unnameable torture in the police cell, and died immediately

upon release, one young girl, Alice Brady, while walking quietly

homewards with her strike allowance of food, was shot by a scab with a

revolver placed in his hands by an employer, and within twenty-four

hours after the murder, that scab was walking the streets of Dublin a

free man. Our murdered sister lies cold to-day in her grave in

Glasnevin—as true a martyr for freedom as any who ever died in

Ireland. But she did not die in vain, and none who die for freedom ever

die in vain.


Well, did the unholy conspiracy against Labour

achieve its object? Was the union crushed? Did our flag come down?


Let me tell you our position to-day, and tell it by an

illustration.


We recently put in a demand for an increase of

wages in Dublin, for all classes of labour in our union. That demand was

eventually met by the employers, and at a Conference between the

representatives of the Union and the Employers were prepared to settle

matters through the Union, and that whatever terms were then agreed upon

would determine the rates for the quays and elsewhere, wherever our men

were employed. Here are a few of the advances thus agreed upon, as well

as the advances arranged with other firms not represented at the

Conference, but dealing directly with the Union Officials.


1. *Stevedores Association*. One penny per ton

increase on all tonnage rules.
2. *Deep Sea

Boats*. One shilling per day on all day wage men.
3. *Casual Cross Channel Boats*. One shilling per

day.


---

p.356

6. *Constant Cross Channel

Boats*. Eightpence per day.
7. *Dublin and

General Company's employees*. Four shillings.
8. *Dublin dockyard labourers*. Three shillings per

week.
9. *Ross and Walpole*. Two shillings per

week.
10. *General carriers' men*. Two shillings

per week granted direct to men after receipt of letter from the

Union.



These comprise the larger firms, many

smaller firms also made advances as a result of action of the Union, and

in every case the advance made was in proportion to the manner in which

the men had stuck to their Union.


The firms whose employees had

fallen away gave poor increases or none at all; the firms whose members

had remained loyal to the Union, paid greater increases, and so the men

reaped the fruits of their loyalty, whilst those who were faint of heart

were punished by the employers for lack of faith in their Union and

their class. So it shall ever be.

COLLEGE GREEN: A LABOUR

CANDIDATE
----------------------------------


At a special meeting, held on Monday, June 7, 1915, the Dublin Trades and

Labour Council unanimously decided to contest the above Division

against John Dillon Nugent. It could not be otherwise. The selection of

Nugent was a studied insult to the Dublin working class, and that class

would not be worth its salt did it not answer this insult by striking

back. Once and for all it must be understood that he who strikes at

labour in Ireland will get blow for blow in return. It may be necessary

to wait patiently for years, but when the opportunity comes the blow

should be swift and decisive and relentless.


When labour strikes

against Nugent in this contest it will have its arm nerved by

remembrance of the poisonous lies and slanders poured upon it during the

great lock-out. It will remember the thousands of homes into which

Nugent brought hunger and misery by the active assistance and

encouragement given to the employers. It will think of all the poor

victimised girls and women whose places were taken by the scabs procured

by Nugent's agents. It will reflect that when it was sought to reduce

the working class of Dublin to the vilest slavery, to break up their

unity and disorganise their forces, it was John Dillon Nugent that stood

forth as their bitterest foe and the most valued supporter of those

who sought to enslave them.


All who stand for the best and

holiest interests of Ireland at this crisis in her history, whatever be

their attitude towards the British Parliament, should now join with

labour in its rally against this man whose malign influence wherever it

has spread has tended to sow the seeds of discord and hatred amongst

Irishmen, and to prevent national unity for truly national purposes.

He has set Irishman against Irishman, brothers against brothers, has

broken up family ties and the ties of community, 


---

p.358


 and been

the ready agent of every evil thing that sought to darken the national

soul and sully the character of the race. He is the incarnation and

flowering of the results upon Irish character of seven centuries of

slavery.


Away with him! Send him back to his intrigues, to his

slandering, to the associates of his secret plots to poison Irish life

and hound down Irish patriots, away with him and *vote for Thomas

Farren*, the candidate of labour, the President of the Dublin Trades

and Labour Council, a man known by all for his stainless record of work

in your service, and loved by all that know him.

MANIFESTO TO THE ELECTORS OF COLLEGE

GREEN
-------------------------------------------


Under the conditions at present ruling in Ireland many

of us would have preferred to let pass unnoticed the election of a

member to represent College Green in the British Parliament. We would

have preferred that course: First, because we deprecate any action

turning the eyes of Irishmen towards England in the present

International crisis. Ireland as a Nation has her own destiny to

achieve, and there is no law of nature which makes it necessary that

that destiny must forever be worked out in terms of British Acts of

Parliament; Second, we would have preferred to let it pass unnoticed and

unheeded because we believe that this Parliament cannot last very

long.


But the selection of John Dillon Nugent as the candidate of

the United Irish League, makes that silence impossible. This selection

is a studied insult to every progressive movement in the country. John

Dillon Nugent is the active figure behind all that is foulest and most

loathsome in Irish Life.


He it is who has stood out as the

malevolent enemy of trade unionism on every occasion, small and great,

where he could exercise his influence. He has attempted to organise in

Ireland, as in the case of the Railwaymen, sectarian trade unions to

divide and disrupt the people of the South as Carson and his gang have

done in the North. He has worked to aid the enemies of organised labour,

and to defeat every effort of the Irish Workers to win for themselves a

decent standard of life, and recognition of their rights as a class.


He has poisoned the political life of the Nation, and struck in the

dark at every influence and every man making for a *self-respecting* people or a progressive

community.




---

p.360


He has been instrumental in making the

Home Rule Party cringe and surrender before every assault of the enemies

of Ireland, and has stood behind every attack upon those whom the

British Government could neither bribe nor terrorise. From Cork to

Enniscorthy, from Dublin to Kerry his sinister figure lurked in the

background, ‘setting’ and directing wherever Irish patriots were

struck at.


He has worked to make it impossible to serve an Irish

Public Board or Corporation in even the humblest capacity, if the

public servant was not ready to be at his beck and call, socially and

politically.


An enemy of Labour, a fomenter of sectarian strife,

a betrayer of all National causes, a source of weakness and paralysis in

all National Movements. This is the man you are asked to elect as your

representative. Will you do it? We ask you to rise and resent the

insult. Let it not be said in this great crisis, when all that is best

and noblest in your natures should be rallying in response to the call

of your country, that you consented to dishonour all Irishmen have ever

held dear, by electing as your representative anywhere, the only man who

most successfully embodies and typifies in his person all that is most

despicable, hateful and corrupting in Irish public life—John

Dillon Nugent.

AFTER THE BATTLE
----------------


The College Green Election is

over, and John Dillon Nugent sits as representative of that Division

in the British Parliament. What more can be said on the matter? The

electors of that constituency made it pretty clear to all who think,

that they deeply resented the attempt of the United Irish League and its

wirepullers to foist upon the Division so deeply detested a man as Mr.

Nugent. But they also demonstrated that against a well oiled and

smoothly working machine a mere sullen, sulky protest is not sufficient.

There were more abstentions in the College Green election on Friday, June 11th, than the number of the

combined poll of Nugent and Farren. These abstentionists had not the

public spirit needed to send them to the polling booth to register their

votes, hence they are represented to-day by a man whose public life has

been spent in furthering everything that they detest.


It is an

object lesson in the value of organisation, and also of the great danger

of such an organisation to public liberties when it is in the hands of

thoroughly unscrupulous men.


The Labour candidate did not win

because the electors were not sufficiently imbued with labour principles

to rally to his aid, and until the electors are so imbued the seat does

not properly belong to labour. On the other hand, although Nugent had at

his command all the secret forces of the Ancient Order of Hibernians

(Board of Erin)*,* all the secret and

public forces of the United Irish League and all the money needed to buy

a horde of corrupt and corrupting scoundrels to debauch the ballot box,

his real vote was so ridiculously small that he has not yet established

any moral claim upon the constituency. The College Green Division is

still open to any candidate of any party to fight for it at the first

opportunity.

p.362


And it may be taken as certain that at

the first occasion labour will again marshal its forces for the fray. As

the popular saying has it the seat is only ‘lent’ to Mr. Nugent.

On this occasion our opponent was in the field a week ahead of us in his

own person, whilst his organisations were busy getting their forces in

order long before the death of Mr. J. P. Nannetti. Between the actual

nomination of Mr. Thomas Farren and the day of the election there were

only three clear days; between the legal nomination of Mr. Farren and

the election there were only two days and a half. Handicapped in this

way, and hard pressed for money all the time*,* the Labour Party did wonders. It has set its claim upon

the constituency; it has now to so educate the voters that when next the

battle is on*,* every worker in the

division will be polled. When that is done we have no fear but that the

victory will be ours.

DUBLIN TRADE AND DUBLIN STRIKES
-------------------------------


What is the real

relation between Dublin strikes and Dublin trade? How have they, how do

they mutually affect each other?


There have been many industries

destroyed in Dublin whose loss it is the habit of certain writers and

speakers to attribute to strikes and labour agitators. How far is that

attitude of mind justified' These are some of the questions that need

careful consideration—and answer.


One answer to them can be

found by a glance at the rate of wages paid in Ireland as compared to

what is paid in Great Britain for the same class of work. It will be

found that Irish workers are invariably paid far below the British rate,

except when the pressure of trade unionism has forced the wages upward

to an equality. This discrimination against equality of treatment for

Irish workers is universal in Ireland whether the employer is a private

individual, or a public authority, such as a Corporation or an Urban

District Council, and ranges all the way from the wages of a tramp navvy

to the ‘salary’ of a national school teacher.


Now observe

well what that fact implies. It means that Irish employers deliberately

refuse to pay Irish workers as well as British employers pay British

workers, and that they do this even when no competition exists. That is

fact, number one.


Fact number two is just as important. It

consists in the fact that whenever a period of unrest occurs, when the

workers in these islands feel and respond to the strivings for a better

existence the Irish employers stand forth in the fight as shining

examples of obstinacy and pig-headedness. Whilst the British employers,

or their agents in Ireland recognise that in the work-a-day world of

business there can be no such thing as complete victory, 


---

p.364




and therefore steer clear of any declaration that would be difficult to

recede from, the Irish employer nails his colours to the mast so

awkwardly that he can not take them down when he wants to. Hence we

continually see the spectacle of the British companies settling with

their employees and turning to work with a zest, whilst the Irish

employer is still ruffling his feathers in wounded dignity, and keeping

up the fight to his own destruction.


In such cases the British

capitalists urge the Irish employer on to the fight, cheer him madly to

his face, wink at each other behind his back, and grab his trade whilst

he is fighting.


Then when the fight is over the Irish employer

looks around for his trade, finds it being done by his British rivals,

and starts bewailing the ‘wicked agitator’. Look around the

history of many important Irish industries that have disappeared in the

course of the past hundred years, and searching below the superficial

crust of shallow-minded writers you will everywhere find the same

tale.


Lots of important industries have disappeared from Ireland

because Irish employers were encouraged to refuse to treat their workers

in a humane and reasonable fashion, and so lost their trade to British

competitors who gloried in their fight, and exulted in their

downfall.


In every big industrial dispute in Ireland the firms

controlled by British capital are always the first to accept a

reasonable settlement, the Irish firms are always the last. The British

firm wants to get back to profit-making, the Irish firm thinks mainly

of humiliating and crushing the workers who dared to defy them.


The explanation is first that the British firms are rather pleased to

see their Irish competitors run their heads against a stone wall, and

their business to bankruptcy; and second, that British capital is

grown up and has assumed the responsibility of the adult, but Irish

capital is still immature, and has all the 


---

p.365


 defects of the

‘hobble-de-troy, not big enough to be a man, and too big to be a

boy’.


Great indeed is the responsibility of the journalist or

publicist of any description who urges on the Irish employer to fight

against a set of conditions to which his British competitors have long

ago adapted their business.


The Irish workers are gradually

accustoming themselves to a self-imposed discipline in the interest of

all; they are learning that it is treason to the trade union for any

gang or group or individual to strike if the striking endangers the

interest of the whole.


What or who will teach the Irish employer

that his power is a trust to be administered for the good of all, not a

whip to be used like a child to gratify his foolish whims?[23](javascript:footNote('E900002-005/note023.html'))

THE PROGRAMME OF LABOUR
-----------------------


We regret that

we are not able to give in our paper a complete report of the splendid

speech delivered under the auspices of the Dublin Trades Council on

Tuesday, January 15 by Father Laurence,

O.F.M.Cap. It was by far the most significant speech yet delivered in

the Trades Hall, and the meeting at which it was delivered was the most

typically illustrative of the spirit of the times. Here we had a great

meeting of workingmen and women overwhelmingly Catholic in their

religious faith, gathering together to discuss problems of social life

and national aspirations with a priest whom they held in affectionate

esteem, but insisting upon discussing these problems in the spirit of

comradeship and equality. Perhaps nowhere else in Europe could such a

meeting on such terms be held, and in such harmony between the parties

concerned.


At one part of his address the reverend lecturer

justly attributed the present position of the Church in France to the

fact that Catholics in that country had wasted their time in dreaming of

the impossible restoration of a monarchy instead of grappling with the

practical work of social regeneration under the new conditions

established by the republic. It is safe to say that such meetings as

that of Tuesday are safer guarantees for Ireland against the growth here

of anti-clericalism of the French type than would be all the pamphlets

of the Catholic Truth Society, without such friendly discussions between

the clergy and the laity. They are a sign that the lesson of France has

not been lost, that the Church recognises that if she does not move with

the people the people will move without her.


It is generally

recognised in Dublin that the editor of this paper represents the most

militant, and what is called the most 


---

p.367


 extreme, type of the

labour movement. We are glad, therefore, to be able to say in all

sincerity that we could see no fundamental difference between the views

expressed by Father Laurence and those views we ourselves hold and never

hesitate to express. The differences were apparently only differences of

definition. The reverend lecturer called things by certain names, we

would use totally different names, but in essence the things were

identical. We both endorsed the principle embodying the things whose

names we could not agree upon. For that reason we on our part, being

more anxious for satisfactory results than for correct definitions,

would not press to contention any of the seeming points of

difference.


To be brief, here is our position as we defined it in

the name of the Irish labour movement: We accept the family as the true

type of human society. We say that as in that family the resources of

the entire household are at the service of each; as in the family the

strong does not prey upon and oppress the weak; as in the family the

least gifted mentally and the weakest physically share equally the

common store of all with the most gifted and the physically strongest;

as in the family the true economy consists in utilising and conserving

the heritage of all for the good of all, so in like manner the nation

should act and be administered. Every man, woman, and child of the

nation must be considered as an heir of all the property of the nation,

and the entire resources of the nation should stand behind all

individuals guaranteeing them against want, and multiplying their

individual powers with all the powers of the organised nation.


To

attain that end we seek to organise every person who works for wages,

that the workers themselves may determine the conditions of labour. We

hold that the sympathetic strike is the affirmation of the Christian

principle that we are all members one of another, whilst those who

oppose the sympathetic strike and uphold sectionalism in trade union 


---

p.368


 struggles are repeating the question of Cain who, when

questioned about the brother he had murdered, asked ‘am I my brother's

keeper’? We say, ‘yes, we are all the keepers of our brothers and

sisters, and responsible for them’.


From the organisation of

labour as such we propose to proceed to organise upon the co-operative

principle that we may control the commodities we ourselves use and

consume. Upon such a basis we can build a true demand for Irish made

goods from which all elements of sweating have been removed.


Recognising that the proper utilisation of the nation's energies

requires control of political power, we propose to conquer that

political power through a working class political party; and recognising

that the full development of national powers requires complete national

freedom we are frankly and unreservedly prepared for whatever struggle

may be necessary to conquer for Ireland her place among the nations of

the earth.


That is the programme of the militant Irish labour

movement. We are rejoiced to find amongst the clergy so many whose

hearts also throb responsive to those ideals.

that a General Council is infallible in doctrinal decisions. Yet we deny

### FOREWORD


Nothing is more conducive to the spread of a movement than the

discussions arising out of the efforts of a capable opponent to refute

its principles. Out of such discussions arise clearness of thought, and

the consequent realisation on the part of both sides to the controversy

of the necessity of considering the movement under discussion in the

light of its *essential principles* rather than of its

accidental accompaniments—the basic ideas of the movement itself

rather than the ideas of the men or women who may for the moment be its

principal exponents or representatives. Men perish, but principles live.

Hence the recent effort of ecclesiastics to put the Socialist movement

under the ban of the Catholic Church, despite the wild and reckless

nature of the statements by which the end was sought to be attained, has

had a good effect in compelling Catholics to examine more earnestly

their position as laymen, and the status of the clergy as such, as well

as their relative duties towards each other within the Church and toward

the world in general. One point of Catholic doctrine brought out as a

result of such examination is the almost forgotten and sedulously

suppressed one, that the Catholic Church is theoretically a community in

which the clergy are but the officers serving the laity in a common

worship and service of God, and that should the clergy at any time

profess or teach doctrines not in conformity with the true teachings

of Catholicity it is not only the right, but it is the absolute duty of

the laity to refuse such doctrines and to disobey such teaching. Indeed,

it is this saving clause in Catholic doctrine which has again and again

operated to protect the Church 


---

p.372


 from the result of the

mistaken attempts of the clergy to control the secular activities of the

laity. It seems to be unavoidable, but it is entirely regrettable, that

clergymen consecrated to the worship of God, and supposed to be

patterned after a Redeemer who was the embodiment of service and

humility, should in their relation to the laity insist upon service and

humility being rendered to them instead of by them. Their Master served

all mankind in patience and suffering; they insist upon all mankind

serving them, and in all questions of the social and political relations

of men they require the common laity to bow the neck in a meekness,

humility, and submission which the clergy scornfully reject. They have

often insisted that the Church is greater than the secular authority,

and acted therefore in flat defiance of the secular powers, but they

have forgotten or ignored the fact that the laity are a part of the

Church, and that therefore the right of rebellion against injustice so

freely claimed by the Papacy and the hierarchy is also the inalienable

right of the laity. And history proves that in almost every case in

which the political or social aspirations of the laity came into

opposition to the will of the clergy the laity represented the best

interest of the Church as a whole and of mankind in general. Whenever

the clergy succeeded in conquering political power in any country the

result has been disastrous to the interests of religion and inimical to

the progress of humanity. From whence we arrive at the conclusion that

he serves religion best who insists upon the clergy of the Catholic

Church taking their proper position as servants to the laity, and

abandoning their attempt to dominate the public, as they have long

dominated the private life of their fellow-Catholics.

 Street Church, Dublin,

serve to illustrate these, our contentions. The Socialists of Ireland

are grateful to those who induced such a learned and eloquent orator in

their capital city to attempt combating Socialism. Had it been an

antagonist less worthy their satisfaction would not have been so great.

But they now feel confident that when an opponent so capable, so wide in

his reading, so skilled in his presentation, so admirable in his method

of attack, and so eloquent in his language, has said his final word upon

the question, they may rest satisfied that the best case against their

cause has been presented which can ever be forthcoming under similar

auspices. In presenting their arguments against the position of the

reverend lecturer—as against his reverend co-workers who all over

the world are engaged in the same unworthy task of combating this

movement for the uplifting of humanity—we desire, in the spirit of

our preceding remarks, to place before our readers a brief statement of

some of the many instances in which the Catholic laity have been

compelled to take political action contrary to the express commands of

the Pope and the Catholic hierarchy, and in which subsequent events or

the more enlightened conscience of subsequent ages have fully justified

the action of the laity and condemned the action of the clergy:


Most of our readers are aware that the first Anglo-Norman invasion of

Ireland, in 1169, an invasion characterised by every kind of treachery,

outrage, and indiscriminate massacre of the Irish, took place under

the authority of a bull issued by his Holiness, Pope Adrian IV. Doubt

has been cast upon the authenticity of the bull, but it is certain that

neither Adrian nor any of his successors in the Papal chair ever

repudiated it.


Every Irish man and woman, most enlightened

Englishmen, and practically every foreign nation to-day wish that the

Irish had succeeded in preserving their independence against the English

king, Henry II, but at a Synod of the Catholic Church, held in Dublin in

1177, according to Rev. P. J. Carew, 


---

p.374


 Professor of Divinity

in Maynooth, in his Ecclesiastical History of Ireland,

the Legate of Pope Alexander III ‘set forth Henry's right to the

sovereignty of Ireland in virtue of the Pope's authority, and inculcated

the necessity of obeying him *under pain of

excommunication*’. The English were not yet eight years in

Ireland, the greater part of the country was still closed to them, but

already the Irish were being excommunicated for refusing to become

slaves.


In Ireland, as in all Catholic countries, a church was a

sanctuary in which even the greatest criminal could take refuge and be

free from arrest, as the civil authority could not follow upon the

consecrated ground. At the Synod of 1177*,*

the Pope, in order to help the English monarch against the Irish,

abolished the right of sanctuary in Ireland, and empowered the English

to strip the Irish churches, and to hunt the Irish refugees who sought

shelter there. The greatest criminals of Europe were safe once they

reached the walls of the church, but not an Irish patriot.


In the

year 1319, Edward Bruce, brother of Robert the Bruce of Scotland, was

invited into Ireland by the Irish chiefs and people to help them in

their patriotic war for independence. He accepted the invitation, was

joined by vast numbers of the people in arms, and together the Irish and

Scotch forces swept the English out of Ulster and Connacht. The English

king appealed for help to Pope John XXII, and *that Pontiff

responded by at once excommunicating all the Irish who were in arms

against the English*.


The battle of the Boyne, fought 1st July, 1690, is generally regarded in

Ireland as a disaster for the Irish cause—a disaster which made

possible the infliction of two centuries of unspeakable degradation upon

the Irish people. Yet that battle was the result of an alliance formed

by Pope Innocent XI with William, Prince of Orange, against Louis, King

of France. King James of England joined with King Louis to obtain help


---

p.375




 to save his own throne, and the Pope joined in the league

with William to curb the power of France. When the news of the defeat of

the Irish at the Boyne reached Rome the Vatican was illuminated by order

of the new Pope, Alexander VIII, and special masses offered up in

thanksgiving. See Von Ranke's History of the Popes and

Murray's Irish Revolutionary History.

Reformation, says truly:

The Irish people as a whole are

proud of the fact that, according to the reported testimony of General

Lee of the American army, more than half of the continental soldiers

during the War of the Revolution were from Ireland, yet during that War

of Independence, Bishop Troy, the Catholic Bishop of Ossory, ordered the

Catholics of his diocese to

> humble himself in prayer that they might avert the *divine wrath

Quite

recently, in 1909, Professor Monaghan, speaking before the Federation of

Catholic Societies in America, declared with the approval of the bishop

and clergy that the Catholic hierarchy of the United States would, if

need be, sell the sacred vessels off the altar in defence 


---

p.376




of the American Republic. *Thus the enlightened opinion of the

Catholics of our day condemns the Pastoral of the Catholic bishop of the

Revolutionary period, and endorses the action of the Catholics who

disregarded it*.


In 1798 an insurrection in favour of an

Irish Republic took place in Ireland, assuming most formidable

proportions in County Wexford. The insurrection had been planned by

the Society of United Irishmen, many of whose leaders were Protestants

and Freethinkers. The Catholic hierarchy and most of the priesthood

denounced the society and inculcated loyalty to the Government. The more

intelligent of the Catholic masses disregarded these clerical denunciations. In the memoirs of his life, Miles Byrne, a staunch Catholic

patriot and revolutionist, who took part in the insurrection, says:

‘The priests did everything in their power to stop the progress of the

Association of United Irishmen, particularly poor Father John Redmond,

who refused to hear the confession of any of the United Irish, and

turned them away from his knees’*.*

Speaking of Father John Murphy, he says he ‘was a worthy, simple,

pious man, and one of those Roman Catholic priests who used the greatest

exertions and exhortations to oblige the people to give up their pikes

and firearms of every description’. The wisdom of the people and the

foolishness of the clergy were amply demonstrated by the fact that the

soldiers burned Father Murphy's house over his head, and compelled him

to take the field as an insurgent. A heroic fight and a glorious

martyrdom atoned for his mistake, but the soldier-like qualities he

showed in the field were rendered nugatory by the fact that as a priest

he had been instrumental in disarming many hundreds of the men whom he

afterwards commanded. As an insurgent officer he discovered that his

greatest hope day in the men who had disregarded his commands as a

priest, and retained the arms with which to fight for freedom.


Dr. Troy, when Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, was, according 


---

p.377


 to an incident related in the Viceroy's Post-Bag

by Mr. Michael MacDonagh, interrogated by the British authorities as to

the duty of a priest who discovered in the confessional a plot against

the Government, and answered that, ‘If in confession any plot against

the existing Government was disclosed to the priest, he (the priest)

would be bound to give information to the Government that such plot was

in agitation, taking care that nothing could in any way lead to a

suspicion of the person from whom, or the means in which, the

information had been obtained’. Chief Secretary Wickham, who reports

this conversation with the archbishop, goes on to say, ‘I then asked

him whether such confession so made to the priest, particularly in the

case of a crime against the State, was considered as a full atonement so

as to entitle the penitent to absolution without a disclosure of such

crime being first made to the police or to the Government of the

country. To this the Doctor answered very distinctly that he did not

consider the confession to the priest alone, under such circumstances, a

sufficient atonement, *and that either the priest ought to insist

on such confession to the State or to the police being made*, or to

enjoin the making of such disclosure subsequent to absolution in like

manner as penance is enjoined under similar circumstances’.


There is little doubt in our mind but that Dr. Troy misrepresented

Catholic doctrine, but it is noteworthy that a parish priest at Mallow,

Co. Cork, ordered a member of the United Irishmen, who had sought him in

the confessional, to give information to the authorities of a plot of

the Royal Meath Militia to seize the artillery at that point and turn it

over to the revolutionists. This priest, Father Thomas Barry, afterwards

drew a pension of £100 per year from the Government for his

information; his action was, and is, abhorred by the vast mass of the

Irish Catholics, but was in strict accord with his duty as laid down by

Archbishop Troy.

Yet we are

informed by Mr. Plowden, a Catholic historian that, ‘a very great

preponderance in favour of the Union existed in the Catholic Body,

*particularly in their nobility, gentry, and clergy*’. On

1st March, 1800, no less than thirty-two

Orange lodges protested against the Act of Union, but the Catholic

hierarchy endorsed it.


Every year the members of the Irish race

scattered throughout the earth celebrate the memory of Robert Emmet, and

cherish him in their hearts as the highest ideal of patriot and martyr;

but on the occasion of his martyrdom the Catholic Archbishops of Dublin

and Armagh presented an address to the Lord Lieutenant, representative

of the British Government in Ireland, denouncing Emmet in the strongest

possible terms. That this action was in conformity with the position of

the whole Catholic Hierarchy was evidenced in 1808, when all the

Catholic bishops of Ireland met in Synod on 14th September, and passed the following

resolution, as reported in Mitchel's History of Ireland:

‘That the Roman Catholic prelates pledge themselves to adhere to the

rules by which they have been *hitherto uniformly guided*,

viz., to recommend to his Holiness (for appointment as Irish Roman

Catholic bishops) *only such persons as are of unimpeachable

loyalty*.’


After Daniel O'Connell and the Catholics of Ireland

had wrested Catholic Emancipation from the British Government they

initiated a demand for a repeal of the Union. Their service to Catholic

Emancipation was a proof positive of their Catholic orthodoxy, but at

the urgent request of the British 


---

p.379


 Government, Pope Gregory

XVI issued a rescript commanding the priests to abstain from attending

the repeal meetings. O'Connell said this was an illegal interference

with the liberties of the clergy, declared he would ‘take his religion

from Rome, but not his politics’, and the Catholic opinion of our day

emphatically endorses his attitude and condemns the action of the

Pope.


In 1847 the Catholics among the Young Irelanders prepared a

memorial to be presented to the annual assembly of the Bishops,

defending themselves from the charge of infidelity. The Archbishop of

Tuam declared he would retire if they were admitted. *They were not

admitted*. To-day the memory of the Young Irelanders is held close

to the heart of every intelligent Irish man or woman.


During the

great Irish famine of 1845-6-7-8-9, the

Irish people died in hundreds of thousands of hunger, whilst there was

food enough in the country to feed three times the population. When the

starving peasantry was called upon to refuse to pay rent to idle

landlords, and to rise in revolt against the system which was murdering

them, the clergy commanded them to pay their rents, instructed them

that they would lose their immortal souls should they refuse to do so,

and threw all the weight of their position against the revolutionary

movement for the freedom of Ireland. Mr. A. M. Sullivan, an extremely

ardent Catholic, writing in New Ireland, says of this

attitude of the clergy during that crisis that, ‘Their antagonism was

fatal to the movement—more surely and infallibly fatal to it

than all the powers of the British Crown’.


The Irish

revolutionary movement known popularly as the Fenian Brotherhood was

denounced by all the Catholic Hierarchy and most of the clergy, Bishop

Moriarty of County Kerry saying that ‘Hell was not hot enough nor

eternity long enough to punish such miscreants’. The Fenians were

represented as being enemies of religion and of morality, yet the 


---

p.380


 three representatives of their cause who died upon the scaffold

died with a prayer upon their lips, and Irish men and women the world

over to-day make the anniversary of their martyrdom the occasion for a

glorification and endorsement of the principles for which they

died—a glorification and endorsement in which many of our

clergymen participate.


In January, 1871, the Catholic Bishop of

Derry denounced the Home Rule movement of Isaac Butt. To-day priests and

people agree that the movement led by Isaac Butt was the mildest, most

inoffensive movement ever known in Ireland.


The Irish Land

League, which averted in 1879 a repetition of the famine horrors of

1847, which broke the back of Irish landlordism, and abolished the worst

evils of British rule, was denounced by Archbishop M'Cabe in September,

1879, October, 1880 and October, 1881.


In 1882 the Ladies' Land

League, an association of Irish ladies organised for the patriotic and

benevolent purpose of raising funds for the relief of distress, of

inquiring into cases of eviction, and affording relief to evicted

tenants, was denounced by Archbishop M'Cabe as ‘immodest and

wicked’. After this attack upon the character of patriotic Irish

womanhood, Archbishop M'Cabe was created a Cardinal.


On 11th May, 1883, in the midst of the fight of

the Irish peasantry to save themselves from landlord tyranny, his

Holiness the Pope issued a Rescript *condemning disaffection to the

English Government*, and also condemning the testimonial to Charles

Stewart Parnell. The Irish people answered by more than doubling the

subscription to the testimonial. The leader of that fight of the Irish

against their ancient tyrants was Michael Davitt, to whose efforts much

of the comparative security of peasant life in Ireland is due. Davitt

was denied an audience by the Pope, but at his death priests and people

alike united to do tribute to his character and genius.


In 1883

Dr. M'Glynn, a Catholic priest in America, was 


---

p.381


 invited to

deliver a lecture for the purpose of raising funds to save from

starvation the starving people of the West of Ireland. The Vatican sent

a telegram to Cardinal M'Closkey ordering him to ‘suspend this priest

M'Glynn for preaching in favour of the Irish revolution’. The

telegram was signed by Cardinal Simeoni. Afterwards Father M'Glynn was

subjected to the sentence of complete excommunication for preaching

revolutionary doctrines upon the land question, but after some years the

Vatican acknowledged its error, and revoked the sentence without

requiring the victim to change his principles.


In all the

examples covered by this brief and very incomplete retrospective glance

into history the instances of the reformer and revolutionists have been

right, the political theories of the Vatican and the clergy

unquestionably wrong. The verdict of history as unquestionably endorses

the former as it condemns the latter. And intelligent Catholics

everywhere accept that verdict. In so far as true religion has triumphed

in the hearts of men*,* it has triumphed in

spite of, not because of, the political activities of the priesthood.

That political activity in the past, like the clerical opposition to

Socialism at present, was and is an attempt to serve God and

Mammon—an attempt to combine the service of Him who in His humbleness rode upon an ass, with the service of those who rode roughshod

over the hearts and souls and hopes of suffering humanity.


The

capitalist class rose upon the ruins of feudal Catholicism; in the

countries where it gained power its first act was to decree the

confiscation of the estates of the Church. Yet to-day that robber class,

conceived in sin and begotten in iniquity, asks the Church to defend it,

and from the Vatican downwards the clergy respond to the call. Just as

the British Government in Ireland on 21st

January, 1623, published a royal proclamation banishing all

priests from Ireland, and in 1795 established a College at Maynooth for

the education of priests, and found the latter course safer for British

rule than the former, so the

 capitalist class has also

learned its lesson and in the hour of danger enlists as its lieutenants

and champions the priesthood it persecuted and despised in the hour of

its strength. Can we not imagine some cynical supporter of the

capitalist class addressing it to-day as the great Catholic orator,

Richard Lalor Shiel, addressed the British Government on the occasion of

the Maynooth Grant of 1845, and saying in his words:

In our

analysis of the discourses against Socialism which formed the burden of

the Lenten Lectures of Father Kane, S.J., we propose to cite at all

times the text we are criticising, and we regret it is not practicable

within our space to quote in full the entire series of lectures, and can

only trust that our readers before making up their minds upon the

question will procure a verbatim report of these discourses in order

that they may satisfy themselves upon the correctness of our quotations.

As far as it is possible, without destroying the unity of our argument,

we shall follow the plan of the lecture itself, and attempt to answer

each objection as it was formulated. But when an objection is merely

stated, and no attempt made to follow it by a reasoned argument

sustaining the objection we shall not waste our readers' time or our own

by wandering off in an attempt to answer. One point stated by our

reverend opponent, and then immediately forgotten or systematically

ignored, requires to be restated here as the veritable anchor from which

the argument should not be allowed to drift. Had our opponent clung to

that anchor it would not have been possible for him to introduce so much

extraneous matter, so much senseless speculation and foolish slander

as he did introduce in the course of his long-drawn-out criticism. That

point, as stated by Father Kane, is: 
> 
> *Once for all
> 
> we must understand a Socialist to be that man, and only that man, who
> 
> holds the essential principle of Socialism, i.e. that all
> 
> wealth-producing power, and all that pertains to it, belongs to the
> 
> ownership and control of the State*.
> 
> 
> 




Thus,

at the outset of his lectures, in his first discourse, the reverend

gentleman makes it clear that Socialists are bound as Socialists only to

the acceptance of one great principle—*the ownership and

control of the wealth-producing power by the State*, and that,

therefore, totally antagonistic interpretations of the Bible or of

prophecy and revelation, theories of marriage, and of history, may be

held by Socialists without in the slightest degree interfering with

their activities as such, or with their 


---

p.384


 proper

classification as supporters of Socialist doctrine. If this great central truth had been made as clear as its importance justifies, and as

firmly adhered to by our opponent as the Socialists themselves adhere to

it, then it would not be necessary for the present writer to remind our

critics of those uncomfortable facts in Irish history to which we have

referred in our introduction, nor to those other facts in universal

history we shall be forced to cite ere our present survey is

finished.


Says our critic: 
> 
> We now come to examine

We are indebted to our critic

for his statement of the importance of this doctrine of the

materialistic conception of history, although we are amused at his

characterisation of the doctrine itself. In the beginning of his

description, ever mindful of the necessity of prejudicing his hearers,

he describes it as an application of the ‘wild philosophic dreams’

of Hegel; in the middle it is stated that the doctrine rejects dreams as

a foundation of religious belief and bases our ideas of religion upon

the impression derived from material surroundings, and in a final

sentence, so far from it being dreams, it is ‘nothing but mud and the

forces of mud’.


Let us examine briefly the true context of

this doctrine. While remembering that there are many good Socialists who

do not hold it, and that a belief in it is *not* an essential

to Socialism, it is still accepted as the most reasonable explanation of

history by the leading Socialists of this world. It teaches that the

ideas of men are derived from their material surroundings, and that the

forces which made and make for historical changes and human progress

had and have their roots in the development of the tools men have used

in their struggle for existence, using the words ‘tools’ in its

broadest possible sense to include all the social forces of

wealth-production. It teaches that since the break-up of common

ownership and the clan community all human history has turned around the

struggle of contending classes in society—one class striving to

retain possession, first of the persons of the other class and hold them

as chattel-slaves, and then of the tools of the other class and hold

them as wage-slaves; that all the politics of the world resolved

themselves in the last analysis into a struggle for the 


---

p.386




possession of that portion of the fruits of labour which labour creates,

but does not enjoy, i.e. rent, interest, profit. Here let us say that no

Socialist claims for Marx the discovery or original formulation of the

doctrine of the materialistic conception of history—indeed, the

brilliant Irish scholastic, Duns Scotus, taught it in the Middle Ages;

but that more precise formulation of the guiding forces of history which

relate to the influence of economic factors, and which we call economic

determinism, has indeed Marx as its clearest expositor, although the

Irish economist, William Thompson of County Cork, in 1826, had pointed

it out before Marx was out of swaddling clothes.


On the first

point, viz., the influence of our material surroundings upon our mental

processes and conceptions, a few words should be sufficient to establish

its substantial truth in the minds of all those who do not fear the

light.


Down on the western coast of Ireland the fishermen use, or

did until quite recently, as their sole means of sea-going, a little

boat made simply of a framework covered with animal hides or tarpaulin,

and known as a coracle. At one time in the history of the world such

boats represented the sole means of ocean travel. Now, is it not as

plain as that two and two make four that the outlook upon life, the

conceptions of Man's relation to nature, the theories of international

relations, of life which characterise the age of the

*Lusitania*, the flying machine, and the wireless message,

could not possibly have been held by even the wisest men of the age of

the coracle. The brains of men were as able then and as subtle in their

conceptions as they are to-day, in fact the philosophers of ancient

Asia have never been surpassed and seldom equalled in brain power in the

modern world; but the most subtle, acute and powerful mind of the

ancient world could not even understand the terms of the social,

political, or moral problems which confront us to-day, and are

intelligently understood by the average day

 labourer. We

are confronted with a salient instance of this in Holy Scripture. We

read the inspired revelation of prophets, judges, and saints giving the

world instructions for its future guidance; we read of commands to go

forth and convey the gospel to the heathen; but nowhere do we read that

those inspired men knew or spoke of a continent beyond the Atlantic in

which immortal souls were sitting in darkness, if souls can be said to

sit. The wise men of the ancient world, the inspired men of the Holy

Land, the brilliant philosophers and scholastics of mediaeval Europe,

were all limited by their material surroundings, could only think in

terms of the world with which they were acquainted, and their ideas of

what was moral or immoral were fashioned for them by the social system

in which they lived. Slavery is held to-day to be immoral, and no

chattel slaveowner would be given absolution; but when Constantine the

Great accepted the Christian religion the Pope of the period received

him with acclamation, and no one suggested to him the need of surrendering his slaves, of which he held thousands. Queen Elizabeth of

England, ‘Good Queen Bess’, engaged in slave trading and made a

good profit in the venture; but no Catholic historian or pamphleteer of

the period ever attacked her for that offence, although attacks for

other causes were made in plenty. How is it that the point of view as to

the morality of slavery has changed? It cannot be that religion is

changed, for we are told that religion is the same yesterday, to-day and

for ever. If it is not because it has been discovered that it is cheaper

to hire men and discharge them when the job is done, than it was to buy

men and be compelled to feed them all the time, working or idle, sick or

well, for what reason has the change in our conceptions come? Stated

brutally, the fact is that slavery is immoral because it is dearer than

wage labour. And so with all our other intellectual processes. They

change with the change in our environment, particularly our economic or

social environment.


A negro slave in the Southern States of

America was told by his owner to go up and fasten the shingles on the

top of the roof of his master's dwelling. ‘Boss’, said he to the

slaveowner, ‘if I go up there and fall down and get killed you will

lose that 500 dollars you paid for me; but if you send up that Irish

labourer and he falls down and breaks his neck you won't even have to

bury him, and can get another labourer to-morrow for two dollars a

day’. The Irish labourer was sent up. Moral: Slavery is immoral

because slaves cost too much.


As man has progressed in his

conquest of the secrets of Nature, he has been compelled to accept as

eminently natural that from which his forefathers shrank as a

manifestation of the power of the supernatural; as the progress of

commerce has taken wealth, and the power that goes with wealth, out of

the exclusive ownership of kings and put it in the possession of

capitalists and merchants, political power has acquired a new basis, and

diplomatic relations, from being the expression of the lust for family

*aggrandisement*, have become

the servants of the need for new markets and greater profits—kings

wait in the ante-chambers of usurers like Rothschild and Baring to get

their consent for war or peace; Popes have for hundreds of years

excommunicated those who put their money out at usury and have denied

them Christian burial, but now a Pierpont Morgan, as financier of the

Vatican, lends out at interest the treasures of the Popes. And man,

caught in the grasp of the changing economic conditions, changes his

intellectual conceptions to meet his changed environment. The world

moves even although men stand still, and not the least of the changes

have been those of the ghostly fathers of the Church towards the world

and its problems. Like the girl to the kisses of her sweetheart, the

Church has ever to the blandishments of the world—

There is

little to refute here that will not have readily occurred to the mind of

the intelligent reader. In fact, the haste with which Father Kane left

this branch of the subject evinced his knowledge of its dangerous

nature. The exposition of the true nature of capital, viz., that it is

stored-up, unpaid labour, forms the very basis of the Socialist

criticism of modern society, and its method of wealth production; it is

the fundamental idea of modern Marxist Socialism, and yet in a discourse

covering four columns of small type in the Irish Catholic

(what a misnomer!) the full criticism of this really fundamental

position takes up only twelve lines. And such a criticism!


‘A

bottle of good wine will have more exchange value 


---

p.391


 than a

bottle of bad wine, even though it may not have cost more labour’.

Does the reverend father not know that if good wine can be produced as

cheaply as bad wine, and in as great quantity, then good wine will come

down to the same price as the inferior article? And if good wine could

be produced as cheaply as porter it would be sold at the same price as

porter is now—heavenly thought! It is the labour embodied in the

respective articles, including the labour of keeping in storage,

paying rental for vaults, etc., that determines their exchange value.

Wine kept in vaults for years commands higher prices than new wine,

but could chemists give new wine the same flavour as is possessed by

stored-up wine, then the new would bring down the price of the old to a

price governed by the amount of labour embodied in the new.


‘A

pair of boots carved out of wood with long and careful labour will fetch

less in the market than a simple pair of brogues’. How illuminating!

But what governs the price of the brogues? Why, the amount of labour

socially necessary to produce them. The amount of labour necessary to

produce an article under average social conditions governs its

exchange value. ‘Boots carved out of wood with long and careful

labour’ are not produced under average social conditions; in

discussing the economic question we discuss governing conditions, not

exceptions. Hence the exchange value of boots such as those instanced by

Father Kane is as problematical as the moral value of his

hair-splitting. If you do not believe labour cost governs the exchange

value of a commodity, ask a Dublin master builder to tell you what

factors he takes into account when he is asked to give an estimate for

building an altar. If he is a Catholic he will cast up his estimate with

the same items as if he were a Protestant—that is to say, he will

count the cost of labour, including the cost of labour embodied in the

raw material, and he will base his estimate upon that cost. Ask any

manufacturer, whether employing two men or two 


---

p.392


 thousand,

how he determines the price at which he can sell an article, and he will

tell you that the cost of labour embodied in it settles that question

for the market and for him. Yet it is this simple truth that Father Kane

and such enemies of Socialism deny. Altars, beads, cassocks, shoes,

buildings, ploughs, books—all articles upon the market except a

politician's conscience—have their exchange value, determined in

like manner—by their labour cost.


The learned gentleman

winds up his lecture with a sneer at Socialist proposals, and an

unwilling admission of the terrible logic of our position in future

politics. He says:

It is

surely not necessary to point out that according to the Socialist

doctrine the capitalist class are themselves doing much of the

constructive work; they, pushed by their economic necessities,

concentrate industries, eliminate useless labour and abolish useless

plants, and prepare industry for its handling by officials elected by

the workers therein. On the other hand, the ‘army of labour, more

enlightened, better organised and more scientifically led’, banded

into industrial unions patterned after the industry in which they are

employed, will have prepared the workers to take possession of the

productive and distributive forces on the day the incapable capitalist

class are forced to surrender to a ‘proletariat *with force,

votes, and law* on their side’.


### THE

RIGHTS OF MAN


The Rights of Man is a doctrine popularised by

the bourgeois (capitalist) philosophers of the eighteenth century, and

has no 


---

p.394


 place in Socialist literature. Although Father Kane

is kind enough to credit Socialism with the doctrine, it is in reality

the child of that capitalist class he is defending, and was first used

by them as a weapon in their fight for power against the kings and

hierarchy of France. Now that capitalism has attained to power and made

common cause with its old enemies, royalty and hierarchy, it would fain

disavow much of the teaching of its earlier days, and hence listens

complacently whilst Father Kane attacks the Rights of Man, and sneers at

the ‘mob’, as he elegantly terms the common people for whom his

Master died upon the Cross. We do not propose to follow the reverend

gentlemen in all his excursions away from the subject, but shall content

ourselves with citing and refuting those passages which have a real and

permanent bearing upon the question at issue.


He begins:

> certain necessary means if others may use them also. Hence his right to

> use. If a man has a right to eat a definite piece of bread, he has a

If one of the

boys at the National Schools could not reason more logically than that

he would remain in the dunce's seat all his schooldays. Imagine a priest

who defends landlordism as Father Kane and the Pope does saying, ‘The

man who has tilled a field through the winter and spring has a right to

hold as his own the harvest which he has earned’, and imagining that

he is putting forward an argument against Socialism. Socialists do not

propose to interfere with any man's right ‘to hold what he has

earned’; but they do emphatically insist that such a man, peasant or

worker, shall not be compelled to give up the greater part, or any, of

‘what he has earned’, to an idle class whose members ‘toil not,

neither do they spin’, but who have attained their hold upon the

nation's property by ruthless force, spoliation and fraud.

That is to say,

that a man has the right to take the means wherewith to live, and he has

also the right to prevent other men taking the means wherewith to live.

The one right cancels the other. When the supply of a thing is limited,

and that thing is necessary, absolutely necessary, to existence, as is

land, water, and the means of producing wealth, does it not follow that

to allow those things to be made private property enable the owners of

them to deny Man ‘the right to live’, except he agrees to surrender

the greater portion of the fruits of his toil to the owners?

*Capitalism and Landlordism are based upon 


---

p.397


 the denial

to Man of his right to live except as a dependent upon Capitalists and

Landlords; they exist by perpetually confiscating the property which the

worker has in the fruits of his toil, and establish property for the

capitalist by denying it to the labourer*. Why talk about the

right to live under capitalism? If a man had all the patriotism of a

Robert Emmet or a George Washington, if he had all the genius of a

Goldsmith or a Mangan, if he had all the religion of a St. Simeon

Stylites or a St. Francis d'Assisi, if he belongs to the working class

he has no effective right to live in this world unless a capitalist can

see his way to make a profit out of him. Translated into actual practice

these ‘natural rights’ of which the reverend gentleman discoursed

so eloquently mean for 23,000 families in Dublin the right to live in

one room per family—living, sleeping, eating and drinking and

dying in the narrow compass of the four walls of one room.


‘When man spends the keenness of his mind and the strength of his

body in winning the fruits of Nature he thereby makes his own that spot

of Nature's field which he tills’, so says his Holiness, as quoted by

Father Kane. It follows then that the Irish peasantry, like the

peasantry of Europe in general, are and were the real owners of the

soil, and that the feudal aristocracy, the landlord class, whose

proudest boast it was, and is, that they have never soiled their hands

by labour, are and were thieves exacting by force tribute from the

lawful owners of the soil. Yet those thieves have ever been supported by

the hierarchy in their possession of property against the peasants who

had made it their own ‘by spending the keenness of their mind and the

strength of their body’ in tilling it.


The working class of

the world, by their keenness of mind and their strength of body, have

made everything in the world their own—its land, its factories,

its ships, its railroads, its houses, everything on earth and sea has

been consecrated 


---

p.398


 by the labour of the working class, and

therefore belongs to that class; and as factories, ships, railroads and

buildings cannot be divided up in pieces, they must be owned in common.

If land belongs to those who have tilled it, by what means, other than

common ownership, shall we re-establish the right of that seventy-five

per cent. of the Irish people who, according to Mulhall, were evicted

between 1837 and 1887, or of those agricultural labourers who toil upon

the land but own no one foot of it, or of all those labourers in towns

and cities whose forefathers have been hunted like wild beasts from the

land they had made their own, by the keenness of mind and strength of

body applied to labour, and who are now compelled to herd in towns,

dependent upon the greed of capitalists for the chance to exist?

This is a puzzle. The word Socialism, and the Socialist principles,

were unheard of until the beginning of the nineteenth century; and

Aristotle flourished in the year 384 B.C. Hence to quote Aristotle as

writing about Socialism is like saying that Owen Roe O'Neill sent a

telegram to the Catholic Confederation at Kilkenny in 1647, or that

George Washington 


---

p.399


 crossed the Delaware in a flying machine.

It is an absurd anachronism. For hundreds of years the works of

Aristotle were used to combat Christianity, principally by the Arabians

in the Middle Ages, and now the same works are used by a Christian

priest to combat Socialism. Truly ‘misfortune makes strange

bedfellows’.

In a criticism of Draper's

 Conflict between Religion and Science, published by the

Catholic Truth Society as the report of a lecture delivered in Cork and

Limerick by the Rev. Dr. O'Riordan, the author says, ‘Owing to the use

which the Arabians had made of the name of Aristotle, his name had

become a word of offence to Christians, so much so that even Roger Bacon

said that his works should be burnt’; and further on, ‘St. Thomas

(Aquinas) took up the philosophy of Aristotle and, purifying it of its

Pagan errors, he established Christian truth out of the reasoning of the

Greek philosopher’. So that, according to Father Kane, Aristotle

‘founded his philosophy on fact, and worked it out through common

sense’, and according to Dr. O'Riordan this philosophy of fact and

common sense was subversive of Christianity until it was ‘purified of

its Pagan errors’. Well, we Socialists, while second to none in our

admiration for the encyclopaedic knowledge of Aristotle, will carry the

purifying process begun by St. Thomas Aquinas a step further. We will

purify Aristotle's philosophy of the teaching he derived from the

slave-world in which he lived, 


---

p.400


 and make it Socialistic. Let

us remind Father Kane that Aristotle's mind was so completely dominated

by his economic environment that he was unable to conceive of a world

in which there would be no chattel slaves, and so declared that slaves

must always exist. A prophecy now falsified for hundreds of years.


We do not propose to follow the reverend gentleman in his wonderful

attempt to discredit the Marxist position on value; that has been dealt

with sufficiently already in the passage upon value in exchange, in

the criticism of the first discourse, and the attempt to elaborate his

position by our opponent in his second discourse is about as

enlightening as an attempt to square the circle generally is. It is

summed up in his declaration that ‘Labour alone cannot create use

value, therefore Labour alone cannot constitute exchange value’.

Which is equivalent to saying that appetite and desire are the real

arbiters in civilised life and under normal conditions of the basis on

which articles exchange among human beings. The appetite and desire of

human beings for water and for bicycles will illustrate to the simplest

mind the absurdity of our opponents' position. Water under normal

conditions in a modern community will not fetch a half-penny the

bucketful, but bicycles retail easily at £7 and £8 apiece.

Yet our desire and appetite for water is based upon a human necessity so

imperative that we would die without its satisfaction, but countless

millions go through life without even straddling a bicycle. What makes

so cheap the article without which we would die? The small amount of

labour necessary to convey it from the mountains to our doors, of

course. And what makes so costly the article that is not a necessity at

all? The comparatively great amount of labour embodied in its

production, of course. Then, what fixes the exchange value of an article

in the normal, modern market? Its cost in labour, certainly.

Dear, oh dear!

What heretics we must be! And yet we are in good company. Saints and

Pontiffs of the Catholic Church have gone before us on this road, and

the wildest sayings of modern Socialist agitators are soft and conservative beside some of the doctrines which ere now have been put forth as

sound Catholic teachings. Read:

The first part of this is clap-trap: the second is rank blasphemy.

The clap-trap consists in the pretence that the Socialist idea of

equality involves the idea that men should be reduced to one moral or

intellectual level. Trade unionists are generally and rightfully in

favour of a minimum wage—a wage below which no worker shall be

depressed. Unscrupulous employers and ignorant journalists and

politicians dealing with this demand strive to make the thoughtless

believe that a minimum wage will prevent higher wages being paid for

extra skill. In other words, they speak as if it were a maximum wage

that was demanded. So with the Socialist idea of equality. Like the

trade unionist our demand is for a level *below* which no man

shall be driven, a common basis of equality of opportunity to all. That

whatever promotion, distinction, reward or honour be given to or

attained by a man shall not confer upon him the right to exploit, to

degrade, to dominate, to rob or humiliate his fellows. And our hope and

belief is that in the future*,* sane men

and women will find as much delight in, strive as eagerly for, the

honour of serving their fellows as they do now for the privilege of

plundering them. Men and women are at all times zealous for honour, for

the esteem of their fellows; and when the hope of plunder is removed out

of the field of human possibility those specially gifted ones who now

exhaust their genius in an effort to rule*,* will as vehemently exert themselves to win the honour

accorded to those who serve.


The second part is, we repeat,

rankly blasphemous. The reverend gentleman, unable to answer the obvious

question 


---

p.404


 he supposes, attempts to draw an analogy between

what he would call the ‘hand of God’ in shaping the faces, forms,

minds and characters of His creatures, and the historical and social

conditions which have created dukes and crossing-sweepers, brainless

aristocrats and intelligent slum-dwellers, morally poisonous kings and

Christian-minded hod-carriers, vile ladies idling in mansions and

clean-souled women slaving over the washtub. The attempt is an insult to

our intelligence. We, as individuals, are not personally responsible

for our faces, forms or minds; these are the result of forces over which

we had and have no control. But the gross injustices of our social

system we are responsible for, in the degree in which we help or

acquiesce in their perpetuation. In the degree in which we support them

to-day we become participators in the crimes upon which they were built.

And what were those crimes? Need we remind our readers of the origin of

private property in Ireland? It had its root in the adulterous treason

of an Irish chief; it was founded upon the betrayal of liberty, and

enforced by the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of the Irish people.

Must we remind our readers that if they seek for the origin of

aristocratic property in Ireland they must seek for it not in the will

of a beneficent Deity, as this bold blasphemer alleges, nor in titles

won by honest labour on the soil, but in the records of English

marauders in the stories of poisonings and treacheries told in the state

papers of the English ruling class, in the light of the burning homes of

Munster in the wake of the armies of Inchiquin,

 who refused to

perjure themselves and yield up Irish tribe lands to greedy aristocratic

thieves from England, or in the log of the emigrant ships, whose course

across the Atlantic was marked by the floating corpses of hunted Irishmen, Irish women and Irish children.


Or shall it be necessary to

recall to our readers the grim fact that the origin of great estates in

England is found in the court records, which tell us that in the reign

of Good Queen Bess*,* 72,000 workers were

hanged in the name of law and order, hanged as vagrants after they had

been driven off the lands they had tilled; that during the peasant wars

of Germany the nobility slaughtered so many poor peasants that one of

the aristocracy eventually called a halt, saying, ‘If we kill them all

we shall have no one to live upon’; that in Scotland 15,000 people

were evicted off one estate in the nineteenth century—the

Sutherland clearances; that in fact in every European country the title

deeds to aristocratic property have been written in the blood of the

poor, and that the tree of capitalism has been watered with the tears of

the toilers in every age and clime and country.


Next, wonder of

wonders, our clerical friend becomes solicitous for a free press and

free speech. He declares:

After you have done laughing at this hysterical

outburst we will proceed to calmly discuss its central propositions. To

take the latter part first, it is very amusing to hear a man, to whom a

comfortable living is assured, assure us that we ought to tell the

Socialist that ‘we will take our chance in the struggle of

life’.


He speaks of our ‘birthright, freedom’, which is

allowed us even by dilapidated modern nations, and that we ought not to

surrender it to the Socialists. In Ireland 87 per cent. of the working

class earn less than 20*s*. per week; in London a million of

people, according to the non-Socialist investigator, Charles Booth, live

below the poverty line—never getting enough to eat; in all

civilisation, according to Huxley, the lot of the majority of the

working class is less desirable than the lot of the mere savage; and

this awful condition of the only class in society that is really

indispensable is the result of the capitalist system, which mocks the

workers with a theoretical freedom and an actual dependence. The freedom

of the worker is freedom to sell himself into slavery to the class which

controls his supply of food; he is free as the wayside traveller is free

of clothes after highwaymen have robbed and stripped him. Says well the

poet Shelley: 
> 1. What is Freedom? Ye
> 
> can tell
>   
> That which slavery is too well,
>   
> For its very name
> 
> has grown
>   
> To an echo of your own.
> 
> 
> ---
> 
> p.408
> 
> * 'Tis to work, and have such pay,
>   
> As just keeps life, from day
> 
> to day,
>   
> In your limbs as in a cell

> 





How can a person, or a class, be

free when its means of life are in the grasp of another? How can the

working class be free when the sole chance of existence of its

individual members depends upon their ability to make a profit for

others?


The argument about the freedom of the press—a

strange argument from such a source—is too absurd to need serious

consideration. Truly, all means of printing will be the common property

of all, and if any opposition party, any new philosophy, doctrine,

science, or even hair-brained scheme has enough followers to pay society

for the labour of printing its publications, society will have no more

right nor desire to refuse the service than a government of the present

day has to refuse the use of its libraries to the political enemies who

desire to use those sources of knowledge to its undoing. It will be as

possible to hire a printing machine from the community as it will be to

hire a hall. Under Socialism the will of the people will be supreme, all

officials will be elected from below and hold their position solely

during good behaviour, and as the interests of private property, which

according to St. Clement are the sole origin of contention among men,

will no longer exist, there will be little use of law-making machinery,

and no means whereby officialdom can corrupt the people.


This

will be the rule of the people at last realised. But says Father Kane,

at last showing the cloven foot, ‘the will of the people would be

nothing more than the whim of the tyrant mob, the most blind and

ruthless tyrant of all, because blindly led by blind leaders’. Spoken

like a good Tory and staunch friend of despotism! What is the political

and social record of the mob in history as against the record of the

other classes? There 


---

p.409


 was a time, stretching for more than a

thousand years, when the mob was without power or influence, when the

entire power of the governments of the world was concentrated in the

hands of the kings, the nobles and the hierarchy. That was the

blackest period in human history. It was the period during which human

life was not regarded as being of as much value as the lives of hares

and deer; it was the period when freedom of speech was unknown, when

trial by jury was suppressed, when men and women were tortured to make

them confess crimes before they were found guilty, when persons

obnoxious to the ruling powers were arrested and kept in prison (often

for a lifetime) without trial; and it was the period during which a

vindictive legal code inflicted the death penalty for more than one

hundred and fifty offences—when a boy was hung for stealing an

apple, a farmer for killing a hare on the roadside. It was during this

undisturbed reign of the kings, the nobles, and the hierarchy that

religious persecutions flourished, when Protestants killed Catholics,

Catholics slaughtered Protestants, and both hunted Jews, when man

‘made in God's image’ murdered his fellow-man for daring to

worship God in a way different from that of the majority; it was then

that governments answered their critics by the torture, when racks and

thumbscrews pulled apart the limbs of men and women, when political and

religious opponents of the state had their naked feet and legs placed in

tin boots of boiling oil, their heads crushed between the jaws of a

vice, their bodies stretched across a wheel while their bones were

broken by blows of an iron bar, water forced down their throats until

their stomachs distended and burst, and when little children toiled in

mine and factory for twelve, fourteen and sixteen hours per day. But at

last, with the development of manufacturing, came the gathering together

of the mob, and consequent knowledge of its numbers and power, and

with the gathering together also came the possibility of acquiring

education. Then the 


---

 mob started upon its upward march to

power—a power only to be realised in the Socialist Republic. In

the course of that upward march the mob has transformed and humanised

the world. It has abolished religious persecution and imposed toleration

upon the bigots of all creeds; it has established the value of human

life, softened the horrors of war as a preliminary to abolishing it,

compelled trial by jury, abolished the death penalty for all offences

save one, and in some countries abolished it for all; and to-day it is

fighting to keep the children from the factory and mine, and put them

to school. The mob, ‘the most blind and ruthless tyrant of all’,

with one sweep of its grimy, toil-worn hand, swept the stocks, the

thumbscrew, the wheel, the boots of burning oil, the torturer's vice and

the stake into the oblivion of history, and they who to-day would seek

to view those arguments of kings, nobles, and ecclesiastics must seek

them in the lumber room of the museum.


In this civilising,

humanising work the mob had at all times to meet and master the hatred

and opposition of kings and nobles; and there is not in history a

record of any movement for abolishing torture, preventing war, establishing popular suffrage, or shortening the hours of labour led by the

hierarchy. Against all this achievement of the mob its enemies have

but one instance of abuse of power—the French reign of

terror—and they suppress the fact that this classic instance of

mob fury lasted but eight months, whereas the cold-blooded cruelty of

the ruling classes which provoked it had endured for a *thousand

years*.


All hail, then, to the mob, the incarnation of

progress!

The intelligent reader

will note that the reverend critic is entirely incapable of grasping

the conception of a state in which the people should rule instead of

being creatures of an irresponsible power, as the people were under the

pagan powers of Rome, to whom he is referring. He says, ‘It

(Socialism) would change our home into a mere lodging-house where are

fed and sheltered the *submissive vassals of the state*’.

Thus it is that he cannot clear his mind of the monarchical conception

of the state; a state which should be a social instrument in the hands

of its men and women, where state powers would be wielded as a means

*by the workers* instead of being wielded as a repressive force

*against the workers* is so strange an idea to him that he

simply cannot understand what it signifies. The reader who understands

this, and perceives the enormous gap in this clerical reasoning, will

understand also that all the terrific bogies which our critics conjure

up as a necessary result of the Socialist state are—only

bogies.


This attempt to develop this theory of the state plunges

him into a mass of contradictions. Read:

Surely here is a

Daniel come to judgment! We had to read this passage over several times

to satisfy ourselves that it was not a quotation from a Socialist

writer, instead of what it purports to be—a part of the discourse of the reverend gentleman himself. For it is the reasoning upon

which is built that materialist interpretation of history the lecturer

has so eloquently denounced. If the reader will turn to the first

lecture he will see that the doctrine of Marx, as explained by Father

Kane, teaches that the economic conditions in which man moves, governs

or determines his conceptions of right and wrong, his social, ethical

and religious opinions. Father Kane there denounced this doctrine in his

most violent language. Now, in the part just quoted, he himself affirms

the same doctrine. He says: 
> 
> The first and most
> 
> *fundamental* principle of ethics is that. . .*man* not flung forward by unreasoning power,
> 
> but led by reason's light, contemplates the order of relations that
>

> 
> *acts so that his action shall be in keeping with his own right

> 
> fact-relations, and *have their moral forces according to the
> 
> deeper order and more fundamental necessity of those fact-relations
> 
> which are the cause of their *existence* and the measure of their
> 
> power*.
> 
> 
> 




If this is not an affirmation of

the Socialist doctrine that our conceptions of right and wrong, and

the political and governmental systems built upon them, have the

‘cause of their existence and the measure of their power’ in the

‘fact-relation’ of man and his fellow-man and not in any divine or

philosophical system of mere thought, then language fails to convey any

meaning. The remainder of the quotation quite as effectually cuts the

ground from under the lecturer's 


---

p.414


 own feet. Observe the last

sentence: ‘A state that is tossed about in its social and political

existence by the fluctuating tide of transient individual opinions,

ambitions, actions, cannot have that healthy, hardy, deathless spirit

which vivifies into the same life not merely the chance companions of a

day, but the successive generations of a nation’. Is not this a

lifelike picture of the capitalist state and its endeavour to build a

system of society which seeks a healthy national existence and social

conscience in ‘transient individual opinions, ambitions, and

actions’, instead of in an ordered co-operation of all for the common

good of all? The whole passage we have quoted is essentially Socialist,

and opposed to that capitalism its author defends. If the doctrine of

economic determinism is heresy, then Father Kane was preaching heresy

from the pulpit.


As if conscious of his slip our critic

immediately makes haste to divert attention by a lurid description of

the ‘Socialist doctrine of divorce’. Socialists as such have no

doctrine of divorce, but a little inconsistency like that does nor deter

our opponents.


There is no Socialist government in the world

to-day, but almost every civilised nation has divorce laws, and the

least Socialist nations and classes have the most divorces; America and

its capitalist class, for example. Our clerical friends proceed upon the

maxim of their sister profession, the lawyers—‘When you have a

bad case abuse your opponent's attorney’, and hence the constant

attempt to slander Socialists upon this point. Now, what is the real

truth on this matter? It is easily stated. Socialists are bound to agree

upon one fundamental, and upon that only. That fundamental is, in the

language of Father Kane, ‘that all wealth-producing power, and all

that pertains to it, belongs to the ownership and control of the

State’. Hence, upon all other subjects there is, and will be, the

widest possible diversity of opinion. Divorce is one of those

non-essential, non-fundamental points upon which 


---

p.415


 Socialists

may and do disagree. But observe this. The law-making authority for

Socialists is their national and international congresses; the

law-making authority of capitalism is its Parliaments, chambers,

congresses, reichstags, etc. Nowhere has a national or international

congress of Socialists imposed divorce upon Socialists as something they

must accept, but in almost every capitalist state the capitalist

law-makers, the spokesmen and defenders of capitalism, have established

divorce as a national institution. Who, then, are the chief supporters

of divorce? The capitalists. And who can come fresh from the divorce

courts, reeking with uncleanness and immorality, to consummate another

marriage, and yet know that he can confidently rely upon Catholic prelates and priests to command the workers to ‘order themselves

reverently before their superiors’, with him as a type? The capitalist.


The divorce evil of to-day arises not out of Socialist

teaching, but out of that capitalist system, whose morals and philosophy

are based upon the idea of individualism, and the cash nexus as the sole

bond in society. Such teaching destroys the sanctity of the marriage

bond, and makes of love and the marriage bed things to be bought and

sold. Can it be wondered at that such teaching as that which exalts the

*individual* pursuit of riches as the absolutely necessary

cement of society should produce a loosening of all *social*

bonds, including that of marriage, and threaten to suffocate society

with the stench of its own rottenness? Yet it is such capitalist ethics

and practice our priests and prelates are defending, and it is of such

Father Kane arises as the champion and expounder.


Certain

Socialists, horrified at this rising stream of immorality, have sought

to find a remedy in the proposal that marriage be regarded as a private

matter over which the state shall have no authority. They do so as

individuals, and many equally good Socialists believe that such an

idea is flatly opposed to the Socialist philosophy; but in itself the

proposal carries 


---

p.416


 none of that loathsomeness the critic

imputes to it. *It is an insult to the entire human race to say

that husbands and wives are only kept together by law, and that women

would become mistresses of one man after another if the law did not

prevent them*. Yet this is what Father Kane said: 
> 
> Divorce in the Socialist sense means that woman would be willing to
> 
> stoop to be the mistress of one man after another.
> 
> 
> 




A more unscrupulous slander upon womanhood was

never uttered or penned. Remember that this was said in Ireland, and do

you not wonder that some Irishwomen—some persons of the same sex

as the slanderer's mother—did not get up and hurl the lie back in

his teeth, and tell him that it was not law which kept them virtuous,

that if all marriage laws were abolished to-morrow, it would not make

women ‘willing to stoop to be the mistress of one man after

another’? Aye, verily, the uncleanness lies not in this alleged

Socialist proposal, but in the minds of those who so interpret it. The

inability of Father Kane to appreciate the innate morality of womanhood,

and the superiority of the morals of the women of the real people to

that of the class he is defending, recalls to mind the fact that the

Council of the Church held at Mâcon in the sixth century gravely

debated the question as to whether woman had or had not a soul, and that

the affirmation that she had was only carried by a small majority. Many

of the early Fathers of the Church were, indeed, so bitter in their

denunciation of women and of marriage that their opinions read like the

expressions of madmen when examined in the cold light of the twentieth

century. Origen said: ‘Marriage is unholy and unclean—a means of

sensual lust’. St. Jerome declared: ‘Marriage is at the least a vice; all that we can do is to excuse and justify it’; and Tertullian, in his hatred of women, thundered forth boldly that which Father Kane dared only insinuate: ‘Woman’, he preaches, ‘thou oughtest always to walk in mourning

and rags, thine eyes filled with 


---

p.417


 tears of repentance to

make men forget that thou hast been the destruction of the race. Woman!

thou art the Gates of Hell’. Thus throughout the centuries persists

the idea of the churchmen that women can only be kept virtuous by

law.


In his further quotation Father Kane is equally

disingenuous. Thus:

The reader will observe there is nothing whatever

in the words quoted from Bebel which justifies the statement that the

child is to be taken from the parents, or brought up a stranger to its

father and mother, or without the influence of a home. There is simply

the statement that it is the duty of the state to provide for the care,

education, and physical and mental development of the child. All the

rest is merely read into the statement by the perverted malevolence of

our critic. And yet this same critic had declared, as already quoted in

this chapter, ‘the reason of civil society is in the

*insufficiency of the family alone* to attain that fuller

perfection of human 


---

p.418


 nature which is the heritage of its

birth’. But when he comes across the Socialist proposal to supplement

and help out that ‘insufficiency’ he forthwith makes it the

occasion for the foulest slanders.

Such a statement as that Christ brought into the

world a change hostile to economic causes could only be made by a

lecturer who presumed either upon lack of historical knowledge on the

part of his audience, or upon the fact that as he spoke 


---

p.419




from a pulpit none of his immediate listeners would dare to point out

his errors upon the spot. All but the merest dabblers in Scriptural

history know that the economic oppression of the Jewish people was so

great immediately before the coming of Christ that the whole nation had

been praying and hoping for the promised Redeemer, and it was just at

the psychological moment of their bondage as a nation and their slavery

as a race that Christ appeared. And it is equally well known that the

priests and comfortable classes—the ‘canting, fed

classes’—refused to acknowledge His message and intrigued to

bring about His crucifixion, whereas it was the ‘common people’

who ‘heard Him gladly’ in Judea, as it was the slaves and

labourers who formed the bulk of His believers throughout the Gentile

world until the fury of the persecutions had passed. Roman and Jewish

historians alike speak contemptuously of early Christianity as a

religion of slaves and labourers. These early Christians had been

socially enslaved. Christ and His disciples spoke to them of redemption,

of freedom. They interpreted, rightly or wrongly, the words to mean an

earthly redemption, a freedom here and now as a prelude possibly to the

freedom hereafter; and hence they joined with enthusiasm the sect hated

by their oppressors. We have had a similar experience in Ireland. The

passionate adherence of the Irish to Catholicity in Reformation times

was no doubt largely due to the fact that the English Government had

embraced Protestantism.


For the last portion of the part quoted

it should not be necessary to point out to anyone other than Father Kane

that of all those things which he asserts Christianity has ‘brought

into the world’ most are not here yet. The ‘duty and honour of

labour’. The greatest honours of church and state are reserved for

those classes whose members do not labour, and highest honours of all

for those who claim that their ancestors have not laboured for a hundred

generations. ‘The lifting up of 


---

p.420


 woman to be man's

helpmate and equal, not his plaything or his property’. She has not

yet attained to that elevation in fact, and the Socialists are the only

ones who claim it for her in their programmes, whereas his Holiness the

Pope has recently denounced her for seeking the right to vote. ‘The

rights of the poor to the superabundance of the wealthy’ is so far

from being recognised that a starving man would be sent for seven years

to prison for stealing a loaf of bread, and a rich man sent to the House

of Lords for stealing a nation's liberty.

With a childishness born of a training in a profession ‘not

concerned with this world’, the reverend gentleman does not realise

that the task of ascertaining and catering for the ‘wants, needs,

desires’, etc., of the nation is done every day by the common

everyday men and women he sees around him—done in a blundering,

imperfect manner it is true, but still it is done. And what is done

imperfectly by the competing forces of capitalism to-day can be done

more perfectly by the organised forces of industry under Socialism.

Government under Socialism will be largely a matter of statistics. The

chief administrative body of the nation will be a collection of

representatives from the various industries and professions. From the

industries they represent these administrators will learn of the demand

for the articles they manufacture; the industries will learn from the

storekeepers of the national stores and warehouses what articles arc

demanded by the general public who purchase at these stores, and the

cumulative total of the reports given by storekeepers and industries

will tell the chief administrative body (Congress, if you will) how much

to produce, and where to place it to meet the demand. Likewise the

reports brought to the representatives from their industrial union as to

the relative equipment and power of their factories in each district

will enable them to place their orders in the places most suited to fill

them, and to supervise and push forward 


---

p.422


 the building and

developing of new factories and machinery. All this is so obvious to a

mind acquainted with the processes of modern industry that it gives the

Socialist a feeling of talking to the baby class when he has to step

aside in order to explain it. All the talk of Socialist flunkeys,

bosses, corruption, favouritism, etc., is the product of minds who are

imagining the mechanism of capitalist business at work in a Socialist

commonwealth, which is as absurd as to suppose that an Atlantic liner of

the present day could be handled on the methods of a fishing boat on the

sea of Galilee in the days of St. Peter. When the workers elect their

foremen and superintendents, and retain them only during effective

supervision and handling of their allotted duties, when industries elect

their representatives in the National Congress and the Congress obeys

the demand emanating from the public for whom it exists, corruption and

favouritism will be organically impossible. Being a merely human society

there will be faults and imperfections of course, but it has also been

whispered that faults and imperfections exist even in the Society of

Jesus. And yet that institution does its work.


Father Kane says:

> 




Observe the phrase, ‘with high incentive to

their talents' use’, and its implied meaning, with great

*monetary* reward. It is a strange fact that when Socialists

preach the necessity and duty of the men and women of genius

*serving* their fellows, instead of using their God-given

genius to *rob* their ‘fellow

p.423


 brothers and

sisters of Christ’, it is always a paid servant of Christ who gets

up to denounce the idea, and to insist that progress will cease unless

men gifted by God get the right to plunder their fellow-men. And yet

Christ said, ‘Give, hoping for nothing in return’. Fortunately,

history knows and teaches us better than the churchmen. It teaches us

that the greatest ‘engineers, doctors, scientists, writers,

statisticians, and inventors’ reaped nothing but their labour for

their pains, that for the most part they died in poverty, and that the

highest incentive they ever possessed was the inward desire to give

outward expression to the divine passion to create*,* planted in their bosoms by Him who knew better than

Father Kane. Under Socialism all will enjoy a full, free, and abundant

life, with every possibility and appliance provided them to serve well

their fellows. And what more could the ‘specialists’ desire?

In previous portions of his tirade the reverend

lecturer has 


---

p.424


 been insisting vehemently that Socialism will

inevitably mean a despotism in which political freedom will be

impossible, and all must conform to the common mould. In this portion he

finds fault with the Socialists because, while in perfect agreement as

to their object, they quarrel over other matters. He says this ‘must

inevitably split in twain the Socialist state’, but he carefully

avoids explaining how the existence of two or more parties will destroy

Socialism any more than it destroys capitalism. There are two, and more

than two, purely capitalist parties in every nation in the civilised

world. The fact that Socialists are as a rule men and women of strong

individuality who fiercely contest for their rights, while it makes

occasional unseemly squabbles in the Socialist ranks to-day, is the

best guarantee that they are not likely to be working for a system which

will crush their individuality or destroy their personal or political

liberty. Also if splits in the party, harsh words among the members, and

even hatreds could destroy the movement it would have died long ago,

instead of growing stronger and more rapidly every day. And surely when

we remember how fiercely hatreds have developed within the Christian

fold—how the Dominicans have fought the Jesuits and the Jesuits

have denounced the Dominicans, how the Lutherans have burned the Calvinists and the Calvinists have burned the Lutherans—we have no

right to demand from an organisation of mere earthly origin more than

was shown by organisations claiming Divine inspiration. Quarrels among

Socialists, forsooth! Have we not had quarrels among Catholics? For

sixty-eight years the Christian world saw two Popes directing and

claiming its allegiance. The Pope at Avignon, supported by half of the

bishops and clergy of the world, excommunicated the Pope at Rome and all

his supporters; and his Holiness at Rome hurled back his curse in

return. In 1046 Henry III of Germany entered Italy and found three Popes

in Rome—all claiming the allegiance of the Catholic world, and

 each other worse than Socialists are denounced

to-day. In 1527 an army of 30,000 troops under the Catholic Constable of

Bourbon attacked and captured Rome, killed the Pope's soldiers,

imprisoned his Holiness Clement VII in the Castle of St. Angelo, and put

the sacred city to the sack. They were all Catholic soldiers under

Catholic officers, and they plundered and ravished the centre of

Catholicity. But, it will be said, these were only quarrels; they were

not disputes over doctrine. Father Kane is a Jesuit; the majority of

priests who at present are in the forefront of the attack upon Socialism

are also Jesuits. Let us remind our reverend critics of a few incidents

in the history of their own order—instances of the fierce disputes

between the Jesuits and other Catholics on points of important Catholic

doctrine:


In India Jesuit missionaries adopted the life and

practices of the Brahmins in 1609 in order to make converts, and in

their desire to conciliate that caste *they even refused the Holy

Sacrament to no-caste pariah converts*. This outrage upon Catholic

teaching and practice was reported to the Pope by a Capuchin Friar,

Norbert, and by the Bishop of Rosalia, and condemned in the strongest

terms by Pope Innocent X in 1645, by Clement IX in 1669, by Clement XII

in 1739, and by Benedict XIV in 1745. Pope Benedict XIV in 1741

denounced the Jesuits as ‘disobedient, contumacious, captious, and

reprobate persons’. Melchior Cano, Bishop of the Canary Islands,

banished the Jesuits from his diocese for teaching false doctrines, and

for the same reason St. Charles Borromeo expelled them from the diocese

of Milan, as did also his successor, Cardinal Frederick Borromeo. We do

not presume to say which side was right in these controversies, but we

submit that if Popes and Jesuits could be wrong, then on a point of

doctrine they can be wrong now on Socialism—a point of economics

and politics.


At the beginning of the seventeenth century a

Jesuit missionary, 


---

p.426


 Father Ricci, gained the favour of the

Chinese Emperor, and he appointed Catholics to all high positions. The

Catholic religion gained a strong foothold in China, established

scientific observatories, and founded schools and universities. But the

Dominican Fathers accused the Jesuits of allowing their converts to

practise their old idolatry, and a fight started between the Jesuits and

Dominicans over this question of what were called the ‘Chinese

Rites’. Nine different Popes condemned these ‘Chinese Rites’,

but the *Jesuits refused to obey the Popes*, and in 1710

imprisoned the Papal Legate of Clement XI in the prison of the

Inquisition of Macao, where he died. Sixtus V, Urban VIII, and Clement

VIII all died so soon after opposing the Jesuits that popular prejudice

accused the Society of having had them assassinated. The Bishop of

Pistoia, Scipio de Ricci, accused the Jesuits of having poisoned Pope

Clement XIV, as did also Cardinal de Bernis, and the Spanish ambassador

to the Court of Madrid declared that several Jesuits had told the Vicar

General of Padua the approximate date on which the Pope would die. In

China the Jesuits in 1700 got an edict from the Pagan Emperor defending

them against the charges of heresy brought by the Pope, but eventually

the fight between the Catholics became so scandalous that the heathens

withdrew their toleration and suppressed the Christian religion in the

empire. In 1661 the Jesuits alone had possessed one hundred and

fifty-one churches and twenty-eight residences in China, had written one

hundred and thirty-one works upon religion, one hundred and three on

mathematics, and fifty-three on physical and moral science. All this was

lost to Catholicity because of Jesuit perversion of Catholic doctrine,

and consequent disgraceful feuds between Catholics. As the Jesuits perverted Catholic doctrine in India and China to gain the support of the

great and powerful, is it wonderful if some think that they and other

ecclesiastics are now again perverting Catholic doctrine for a like

purpose?

The Socialist doctrine teaches that all men are

brothers, that the same red blood of a common humanity flows in the

veins of all races, creeds, colours and nations, that the interests of

labour are everywhere identical, and that wars are an abomination. Is

not this also good Catholic doctrine—the 


---

p.428


 doctrine of

a Church which prides itself upon being universal or Catholic? How,

then, can that doctrine which is high and holy in theory on the lips of

a Catholic become a hissing and a blasphemy when practised by the

Socialist? The Socialist does not cease to love his country when he

tries to make that country the common property of its people; he rather

shows a greater love of country than is shown by those who wish to

perpetuate a system which makes the great majority of the people of a

country exiles and outcasts, living by sufferance of capitalists and

landlords in their native land. Under Socialism we can all voice the

saying of the poet; at present ‘our’ native land is in pawn to

landlords and capitalists.


When the reverend lecturer hurls at

the Socialists the taunt that they are the worst enemies of their own

country, whatever that country be, he is only repeating against us the

accusation made more truly in times past against the order of which he

is such an ornament. The Jesuits have been expelled from every Catholic

country in Europe, and the grounds on which they have been expelled were

everywhere the same, viz., that they were the worst enemies of their

country, and were constantly intriguing against the government and

national welfare, that their teaching made bad subjects, and all their

influence was against the welfare of the state—just what they

allege against Socialists to-day. They were expelled from Venice during

the first half of the seventeenth century, from Portugal in 1759, from

the French dominions in 1764 and 1767, from Spain in 1767, from Naples,

Parma and Modena about the same time. Maria Theresa of Austria and

Emperor Joseph, her son, also expelled them. The kings of Spain,

Portugal and France united in an ultimatum to the Pope threatening to

withdraw their countries from fealty to Rome and to create a schism

unless the Pope suppressed them, and finally in a Brief issued July 21st, 1773, his Holiness, Pope Clement

XIV, suppressed the Jesuits ‘in all the States of Christendom’. 


---

p.429


 As the Catholic author of the article on the Jesuits in the

 Encyclopaedia Americana truly says, ‘They have been

expelled over and over again from almost every Catholic country in

Europe’. In 1601 the secular priests of England issued a pamphlet

entitled, ‘ Important Considerations’, in which they

laid the blame of the Penal Laws against Catholics upon the Jesuits. The

author of this work, William Watson, afterwards died a martyr for the

Catholic faith. The Papal Brief, Dominus ac

Redemptor, speaks of their defiance of their own

constitution, expressly revised by Pope Paul V, *forbidding them to

interfere in politics*, of the great ruin to souls caused by their

quarrels with local ordinaries and other religious orders, *the

conformity to heathen usages in the East*, and the disturbances

resulting in persecution of the Church which they have stirred up even

in Catholic countries, so that several Popes have been obliged to punish

them. It is instructive to recall that upon their suppression the

Jesuits took refuge in Russia under Catherine, and in Prussia under

Frederick, both sovereigns being freethinkers. Not until the French

Revolution had frightened all liberal ideas out of the crowned heads of

Europe, and the fall of Napoleon enabled the sceptred tyrants of England

and the Continent to place their iron heels upon the necks of the

people, did the Jesuits once more receive an invitation to resume their

activity and their existence as an order. That invitation was coincident

with the suppression of all popular liberties, and the enthronement of

absolute power.


Is it not, then, a joke to see Socialists accused

of being unpatriotic, and accused by a Jesuit?


### GOD OR MAMMON


In his fifth lecture our reverend critic

simply refurbishes and places upon exhibition all the individual

opinions of individual Socialists he can find antagonistic to religion,

and 


---

p.430


 tells us that their individual opinions are orthodox

Socialist doctrines. After having for four weeks beaten the air in a

wild endeavour to convince us that the Church is and always was against

Socialism, that Socialists were and are beasts of immorality,

uncleanness and treason, he affects to be horrified at the idea of those Socialists thinking and saying harsh

things about the religion whose priests have been so busy slandering and

vilifying them. We would say to him, and all others, that if the

pioneers of the Socialist movement were indeed freethinkers, so much the

more shame to the Church that, by neglecting its obvious duty, left

freethinkers to do the work in which churchmen ought to have been their

leaders


Sufficient to remind our readers that, even according

to the oft-repeated assertion of Father Kane, Socialism means a state of

society in which the will of the people should be supreme, that

therefore Marx and Bebel and Liebknecht and Vandervelde and Blatchford

were not and are not working for the establishment of a system in

which they would be able to force their theories about religion upon the

people, but for a system in which the people would be free to accept

only that of which their conscience approved. In the light of that

central truth how absurd seems the following passage: 
> 
> Now, in Socialism there are principles which no real Catholic can
> 
> hold. First, Socialists hold that private ownership is in itself wrong;
> 
> that, no Catholic can admit. Secondly, Socialists maintain that the
> 
> child is the property of the state as against the father's right;
> 
> that, no Catholic can admit. Thirdly, Socialists recognise divorce as a
> 
> breaking of the marriage bond; that, no Catholic can admit. Fourth,
> 
> Socialists limit and confine religion to mere personal private worship;
> 
> that, no Catholic can admit.
> 
> 
> 




We have seen that

saints and Popes denounced private ownership of the means of life. We

challenge the reverend father to produce from any Socialist congress

or party a 


---

p.431


 declaration that Socialists desire to take the

child from the father or mother, but we will produce many declarations

that it is the right of the state to help fathers and mothers to support

their children, and, finally, we flatly deny, and brand as an

unqualified falsehood, the statement that the Socialist programme

declares for the breaking of the marriage bond. Our reverend and holy

critics make it appear that the Socialist idea of society must be

responsible for the other ideas held by some of its sponsors. Why not

apply this to the Catholic Church then? When King Edward VII of England

ascended the throne he swore that the Mass was blasphemous and

idolatrous; and when he died the Vatican went into mourning. Did the

Vatican believe that the institution of monarchy was not to be blamed

for the official declarations of its supporters? And if so, why blame

Socialism for the private, non-official, declaration of a few of its

supporters?


Recently there died in Europe a king—King

Leopold of Belgium—whose private life was so disgracefully

immoral that it was the scandal of Europe. A married man with a grown-up

family, he kept a Parisian actress as his mistress, and led so

scandalous a life that the females of his family refused to follow his

body to the grave. Yet when he died the whole official Catholic world

went into mourning for him. He was more of a representative of the

institution of monarchy than any private individual can ever be of

Socialism; but the Rev. Father Kane or his Holiness the Pope did not

therefore deliver sermons against the wickedness of supporting kings.

And what is true in these two striking examples is also true of kings,

nobles, and capitalists all the world over. In the United States the

divorce rate for 100,000 of the population rose from 23 in 1880 to 73 in

1900. Between 1887 and 1906 the total number of divorces was 945,625.

*This enormous increase of divorces was almost entirely among the

classes least affected by Socialist teaching*—the middle and

upper capitalist class. 


---

p.432


 That is to say, among the class our

reverend opponent is defending. Why all this howl about supposed

Socialist theories of divorce, and all this silence about the capitalist

practice thereof?

When he makes

the damaging admission he does in the point we have put in italic type,

our reverend friend knocks the feet from under his own case; and when he

goes on to wriggle still further in an attempt to cloud the issue he

reveals that his purpose is not to discuss Socialism so much as to

traduce it. He admits that logically there is no connection between

Socialism and atheism, and yet his whole discourse was a long-drawn-out

attempt to prove such a connection. In what other walk of life would a

man be tolerated who indulged in such senseless hair-splitting as the

foregoing, or in such vilification as the following?

Note the

words, ‘Under Socialism criminals would be the authorised spokesmen of

your principles’. He has repeatedly asserted that under Socialism the

will of the people would rule, and now he asserts that the people would

choose criminals as their spokesmen. Yet such a thing as a Socialist

criminal is practically unknown in the records of the police courts of

the world. Can any sane man believe that if the ‘means of wealth

production and kindred powers’ were common property the people

would be so debased by the enjoyment 


---

p.434


 of the full fruits of

their labour that they would elect criminals to be their spokesmen and

rulers? Or that a man cannot worship God unless he concedes the right of

a capitalist to three-fourths or more of the fruits of his labour? Or

that a people cannot love their country if they own it as their common

property? Or that a nation would commit suicide if it refused to allow

a small class to monopolise all its natural resources and means of life?

Or that the nation which refused to allow a class to use the

governmental machinery for personal aggrandisement to stir up wars and

slaughter thousands of men ‘made in the image of God’ for the sake

of more profits for a few, that the nation which should refuse to allow

this would be ‘powerless in the moral order’, and hastening on to

decay? Yet it is this monstrous farrago of nonsense Rev. Father Kane

attempts to establish in his fifth lecture.

That some Socialists believe that force may be

used to inaugurate the new social order only indicates their conviction

that the criminal capitalist and ruling classes will not peacefully

abide by the verdict of the ballot, but will strive by violence to

perpetuate their robber rule in spite of the declared will of the

majority of the people. In this conviction such Socialists are

strengthened by the record of all the revolutions of the world's

history. It is a well-established fact that from the earliest revolutionary outbreak known down to the Commune of Paris, or Red Sunday in

Russia, the first blood has been shed, the first blow struck, by the

possessing conservative classes. And we are not so childish as to

imagine that the capitalist class of the future will shrink from the

shedding of the blood of the workers in order to retain their ill-gotten

gains. They shed more blood, destroy more working class lives every

year, by the criminal carelessness with which they conduct industry and

drive us to nerve-racking speed, than is lost in the average

international war. In the United States there are killed on the

railroads in one year more men than died in the Boer War on both sides.

When the capitalists kill us so rapidly for the sake of a few pence

extra profit it would be suicidal to expect 


---

p.436


 that they would

hesitate to slaughter us wholesale when their very existence as

parasites was at stake. Therefore, the Socialists anticipate violence

only because they know the evil nature of the beast they contend with.

But with a working class thoroughly organised and already as workers in

possession of the railroads, shops, factories and ships, we do not need

to fear their violence. The hired assassin armies of the capitalist

class will be impotent for evil when the railroad men refuse to

transport them, the miners to furnish coal for their ships of war, the

dock labourers to load or coal these ships, the clothing workers to

make uniforms, the sailors to provision them, the telegraphists to serve

them, or the farmers to feed them. In the vote, the strike, the boycott

and the *lockout exercised against the master class*, the

Socialists have weapons that will make this social revolution

comparatively bloodless and peaceable, despite the tigerish instincts or

desires of the capitalist enemy, and the doleful Cassandra-like

prophecies of our critic.


And if the capitalists do abide the

issue of the ballot and allow this battle to be fought out on lines of

peaceful political and economic action, gladly we will do likewise. But

if not—

This argument is brought in after telling

a silly story about a Socialist who wanted Rothschild to divide up, and

the story is told despite the fact that the reverend and pious lecturer

has frequently explained that Socialism has nothing to do with dividing

up. In fact Socialists want to stop dividing up with the

‘irresponsible easy-going loafers’, called aristocrats and

capitalists, in the ‘idealised workhouses’, known as palaces and

mansions. All those poor workers whom he mentions—the small

farmer, the cottager, the cabman, the apple-woman, the doctor—all

are compelled to divide up with the capitalist, speculator and landlord,

and Socialism proposes to them that instead of wearing life out working

night and day as in the case of the doctor, or shivering and suffering

as in the case of the farmer, the cottager, the cabman, and the

apple-woman, they shall help to establish a system of society where the

functions they now perform shall be performed better through more

perfect organisation, with equipment supplied by the community, and

where they shall be honoured co-workers with all their fellow-workers,

with an old age guaranteed against the want and privation they know

awaits them under the present order. And they are hearkening to this

Socialist promise of relief from their present social purgatory.


Father Kane next proceeds to quote Socialists to prove the

beneficence of medieval Catholicism. He says:

This long extract should be enlightening and illuminating to our

readers. It shows that the Socialists have been uniformly fair in their

treatment of the attitude of the Catholic Church of the past towards the

poor, that they have defended that Church from the attacks of

unscrupulous Protestant historians, upon that point, so that our

reverend friend has to admit that a correct knowledge of the contrast

between the attitude of the Church and that of the Protestant reformers

can be best

 attained by whoever studies Socialist

literature. But, as we pointed out in a previous chapter, when Father

Kane is recounting the numberless murders, outrages, and barbarities

practised upon the poor by the aristocracy of the Reformation he is

telling also where we are to find the title deeds of the landed estates

of England and Ireland. And it is just those landed estates, gained by

such means, that Father Kane and his like are fighting to perpetuate in

the ownership of the English and Irish aristocracy to-day. How do the

Catholic clergy dare to defend the possessors in the present possession

of their stolen property, when they publicly proclaim from the altar

their knowledge of the inhuman crimes against God and man by which

that property passed out of the hands of Church and people? The

Reformation was the capitalist idea appearing in the religious field; as

capitalism teaches that the social salvation of man depends solely

upon his own individual effort, so Protestantism, echoing it, taught

that the spiritual salvation of man depends solely upon his own

individual appeal to God; as capitalism abolished the idea of social

interdependence which prevailed under feudalism, and made men isolated

units in a warring economic world, so Protestantism abolished the

interdependent links of priests, hierarchy, and pontiffs which in the

Catholic system unites man with his Creator, and left man at the mercy

of his own interpretations of warring texts and theories. In fine, as

capitalism taught the doctrine of every man for himself, and by its

growing power forced such doctrines upon the ruling class, it created

its reflex in the religious world, and that reflex, proclaiming

individual belief was the sole necessity of salvation, appears in

history as the Protestant Reformation. Now, the Church curses the

Protestant Reformation—the child; and blesses capitalism—its

parent.

And

so he concludes—with an appeal for pity for the poor. After all

his long discourse, after again and again admitting the tyranny, the

extortions, the frauds, the injustices perpetrated in our midst every

day by those who control and own our means of existence, he has no

remedy to offer but pity! After all his brave appeal to individuality,

to national honour, to the heroic spirit in poor men and women, he

shrinks from appealing to that individuality, to that national honour,

to that heroic spirit in the poor and asking them so to manifest

themselves as to rescue their lives from the control of the forces

 of mammon. Professing to denounce mammon, he yet shrinks from

leading the forces of righteousness against it, and by so shrinking

shows that all his professed solicitude for justice, all his vaunted

hatred of tyranny, were ‘mere sound and fury signifying

nothing’.


Is not this attitude symbolic of the attitude of

the Church for hundreds of years? Ever counselling humility, but sitting

in the seats of the mighty; ever patching up the diseased and broken

wrecks of an unjust social system, but blessing the system which made

the wrecks and spread the disease; ever running divine discontent and

pity into the ground as the lightning rod runs and dissipates

lightning, instead of gathering it and directing it for social

righteousness as the electric battery generates and directs electricity

for social use.


The day has passed for patching up the capitalist

system; it must go. And in the work of abolishing it the Catholic and

the Protestant, the Catholic and the Jew, the Catholic and the

Freethinker, the Catholic and the Buddhist, the Catholic and the

Mahometan will co-operate together, knowing no rivalry but the rivalry

of endeavour toward an end beneficial to all. For, as we have said

elsewhere, Socialism is neither Protestant nor Catholic, Christian nor

Freethinker, Buddhist, Mahometan, nor Jew; it is only *HUMAN. We of

the Socialist working class realise that as we suffer together we must

work together that we may enjoy together*. We reject the firebrand

of capitalist warfare and offer you the olive leaf of brotherhood and

justice to and for all.
