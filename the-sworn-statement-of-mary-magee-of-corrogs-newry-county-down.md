I, Mary Ellen Magee, of Corrogs, Newry, County Down, do hereby solemnly declare that the statements made herein are the truth, so help me God.


On Wednesday, June the 8th, at or about the hour of 8 o'clock in the evening I heard voices (which I afterwards found to be those of Special Constabulary) speaking to my brother, Stephen Magill, at the door of our house. They were asking him was his brother in the house. Before he could reply my brother, Owen Magill, walked out to the side of Stephen. They were only a few feet from the door when I heard the order ‘Hands up’ and the next thing I heard was a volley of shots. I ran to the door and saw my brother, Stephen, falling, and my brother, Owen, ran to me and said to me, ‘I'm done’. I took my brother, Owen, round to the back of the house and helped to bandage his wound, which was in his right side. He was quite conscious and did not appear to be seriously wounded. My brother, Stephen, was shot through the heart and died in a few minutes. His wound appeared to be caused by an explosive bullet as the gash in his breast was almost two inches in diameter.


When the Specials left we took my brother, Owen, into the house and he undressed himself and went to bed. At about I0 p.m. the Specials returned and inquired for my brother, Owen, who was wounded. They told him they were going to take him to hospital and they told me the same. My father was in the room with my brother at the time; the Specials kicked him from the room and abused him badly. My father is aged 78. Then my brother, Owen, walked out of the house with the Specials, and as far as I know, walked over 200 yards to the military lorry which was in waiting. They did not allow my brother to put on his coat but took him away in his shirt and trousers. As far as can be ascertained my brother was dead when he arrived at the hospital.


The Specials returned on June 10th, and raided our house. They knocked down a stack of hay, and threw clothes and other things on the yard. On Sunday, June 12th, they again returned. Neither my father nor myself were in the house at the time. They broke open the door and tossed everything over the house, pitching beds, clothes and everything here, there and everywhere. They again returned on June 18th.


On the occasion of their visit on June 8th, they followed me through the fields, and threatened to shoot me if I did not tell them where my wounded brother was, he having hid himself under the bed when he heard they were coming the second time. This is a true statement of all the main facts of the case.


Mary Ellen Magee.June 20th,'21
