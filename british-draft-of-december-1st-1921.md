6. Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of the British Islands, including Ireland, shall be undertaken exclusively by His Majesty's Imperial Forces.


7. The Government of the Irish Free State shall afford to His Majesty's Imperial Forces:
1. (a) In times of peace such harbour and other facilities as are indicated in the Annex hereto, or such other facilities as may from time to time be agreed between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State, and
2. (b) In times of war or of strained relations with a foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purpose of such defence as aforesaid.



8.

16. After the expiration of the period of transition, if no such address as is mentioned in Article 14 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern Ireland the powers conferred on them by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, but the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall in Northern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act (including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland, subject however to the provisions:

1. (a) The Government of Northern Ireland shall exercise the powers of patronage with respect to offices in the public services administered by the Government of the Irish Free State (including judicial offices) the functions of which are discharged either wholly or mainly in Northern Ireland.

17. By way of provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval which must elapse between the date hereof and the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State in accordance therewith, steps shall be taken forthwith for summoning a meeting of members of Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and for constituting a provisional Government, and the British Government shall take the steps necessary to transfer to such provisional Government the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties, provided that every member of such provisional Government shall have signified in writing the acceptance of this instrument. But this arrangement shall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from the date hereof.
