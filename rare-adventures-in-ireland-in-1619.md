### Rare Adventures in Ireland in 1619: Author: William Lithgow




---

p.403


But now having finished the two descriptions of my first and second adventures, it rests now most necessary to relate the meritorious design, and miserable effect, of my third voyage. After I had (I say), by the great providence of God, escaped infinite dangers by seas, suffering thrice shipwreck; by land, in woods, and on mountains, often invaded; by ravenous beasts, crawling and venomous worms, daily incumbered; by home-bred robbers, and remote savages, five times stripped to the skin; excessive fatigue, unspeakable adversities, parching heats, scorching drought, intolerable distresses of hunger, imprisonments, and cold; yet all these almost incredible sufferings past, could never abate the flame of my austere affection conceived; but ambitious curiosity exposing me to a third voyage, I may say as Aeneas did in his penitential mood,


> 1. O socii, (neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum)
>   
> O passi graviora: dabit Deus his quoque finem.
> 



> 1. O socials! we're not ignorant of losses;
>   
> O sufferings sad, God too will end these crosses.
> 




But to observe a methodical order, I think it best to shew the unacquainted reader a reasonable satisfaction for undertaking this third, and almost invincible attempt.


First, The most special and urgent cause proceeded from a necessary good (the necessity of knowledge) in the requisite perfection of Europe's full and spacious sight, the ancient tierce, and now most Christian world, leaving formerly no part thereof unseen, as well under

the Turk as Christian, except Ireland, and the half of Spain.


*Certain approved reasons.* The second cause was moved from a more insatiate content, that when I had compassed all Europe, my resolution was, to travel a larger extent of ground in Afric than formerly I had done twice before, even to Aethiopia, **Prester John**'s domininons. For the same effect, and a greater impression to my resolution, I set pen to paper, drawing from the distaff of the muses a poetical pamphlet, dedicated to themselves, to their profound Apollo, his then hopeful heir, and divers noble peers of both kingdoms.


And having, from a royal favour, obtained his Majesty's letters, and seals of safe conduct, and regal recommendation to all kings, princes, and dukes, &c. I, in all obsequious humility, bid farewel to this sequestrate and most auspicious monarchy; and arriving at **Dublin** in Ireland, August 22, 1619, I saluted the Right Honourable **Sir Oliver St John**'s, late **Lord Grandison**, and then Lord-deputy there; to whom, for regard and singular courtesies, I was greatly obliged; so was I also to many of the English nobility and knighthood there, who, through the whole country where-ever I came, entertained me kindly, sending guides with me from place to place; yea, and sometimes safeguards also; beside in their houses great good cheer and welcome. *The matchless **Lord Chichester**, for virtue, wisdom, and valour.* But in special, a dutiful remembrance I owe to the memory of that once judicious and religous Lord **Arthur, late Lord Chichester, Baron of Belfast**, &c.; who, in his time, for virtue, wisdom, and valour, wore the diadem of love, and garland of true nobleness. Of whom, and for whose loss, if I should more praise, and longer lament, my ink would turn to brinish tears, and I to helpless sorrow. But leaving him who lived in goodness here, and now in glory for ever, I celebrate these lines to his eternal fame.

And now, after a general survey of the whole kingdom (the north-west part of **Canoch** excepted) was accomplished, from the 1st of September till the last of February, I found the goodness of the soil more than answerable to my expectation, the defect only remaining (not speaking of our colonies) in the people, and from them, in the bosom of two graceless sisters, Ignorance and Sluggishness.


*The four provinces of Ireland.* This kingdom is divided into four provinces, although some make five, that is, eastern and western **Maith**; but they are understood to be annexed to **Leinster**. Their names are these, **Leinster**, **Munster**, **Ulster**, and **Canoch**; the southmost wherof is **Munster**, a soil (and so is Leinster in most parts) nothing inferior, if seasonably manured, to the best grounds in England. The island lieth almost in a rotundo, being every way spacious; the greatest river whereof is **Shannon**, whose course amounteth to a hundred and sixty miles, inclosing within it many little isles.


And this I dare avow, there are more rivers, lakes, brooks, strands, quagmires, bogs, and marshes in this country, than in all Christendom besides; for travelling there in the winter, all my daily solace was sinkdown comfort; sometimes boggy plunging deeps, touching my horse's belly; sometimes over-mired saddle, body, and all; and often and ever set a swimming, in great danger, both I and my guides, of our lives;

that for cloudy and fountain-bred perils, I was never before reduced to such a floating labyrinth. Considering that, in five months space, I quite spoiled six horses, and myself as tired as the worst of them.


And now I call to memory, (not without derision), though I conceal the particular place and prelate, it was my fortune, in the county of **Dunnegal**, to be jovial with a bishop at his table; where, after divers discourses, my ghostly father grew offended with me for terming of his wife mistress; which, when understood, I both called her Madam and Lady Bishop. Whereupon he grew more incensed, and I left him unsatisfied. Resolve me, reader, if it be the custom here or not? and if, amends shall repay oversight, a ghostly wife shall be still Madam Lady with me; if not, my observed manner shall be Mistress.


*The ignorant and sluggish life of the common Irish.* But now, to come to my intended discourse of **Ireland**, true it is, to make a fit comparison, the Barbarian Moor, the Moorish Spaniard, the Turk, and the Irishman, are the least industrious, and most sluggish livers under the sun; for the vulgar Irish, I protest, live more miserably in their brutish fashion, than the undaunted or untamed Arabian, the devilish idolatrous Turkoman, or the moon-worshipping Caramines; shewing thereby a greater necessity they have to live, than any pleasure they have, or can have, in their living.


Their fabrics are advanced three or four yards high, pavilion-like incircling, erected in a singular frame of smoke-torn straw, green long-pricked turf, and rain-dropping wattles. Their several rooms, of palatiate divisions, as chambers, halls, parlours, kitchens, barns, and stables, are all inclosed in one, and that one perhaps in the midst of a mire; where, when in foul weather, scarcely can they find a dry part whereupon to repose their cloud-baptized heads. Their shirts being woven of the wool or linen of their own nature, and their penurious food like to their ruvid condition.

p.407


And, lastly, these only titular Christians are so ignorant in their superstitious profession of Popery, that neither they, nor the greatest part of their priests, know or understand what the mystery of the mass is, which they daily see, and the other celebrate, nor what the name of Jesus is, either in his divine or human nature. Ask him of his religion, he replieth, What his father, his great-grandfather were, that will he be also. And hundreds of better than the common sort have demanded me, if Jerusalem and Christ's sepulchre were in Ireland, and if the Holy Land was contiguous with St Patrick's purgatory?


*A foolish and superstitious error.* They also, at the fight of each new moon[1](javascript:footNote('E610003-001/note001.html')), (I speak it credibly), bequeath their cattle to her protection, humbly imploring the pale lady of the night, that she will leave their bestial in as good plight as she found them; and if sick, scabbed, or sore, they solicit her maiden-faced Majesty to restore them to their health. In which absurdity they far surmount the filly Sabunks, and Garolinean Moors of Libya[2](javascript:footNote('E610003-001/note002.html')). Indeed of all things (besides their ignorance) I only lamented their heavy bondage under three kinds of masters; the landlord for his rent, the minister for his



---

p.408




tithes, and the Romish priest for his fees. And remark, when their own Irish rent-masters have any voyage for **Dublin**, or peradventure superspended at home in feasting of strangers, then must these poor ones be taxed and afflicted with the supply of the wasted provision of their prodigal houses; otherwise in supporting their superfluous charges for **Dublin**.


O what a slavish servitude do these silly wretches endure, the most part of whom, in all their lives, have never third-part food, nature's clothing, nor a secure shelter for the winter's cold!


The miserable sight whereof, and their sad-sounding groans, have often drawn a sorrowful remorse from my humane compassion.


As for their gentry, such as are brought up here at **London**, learn to become a great deal more civil than those who are brought up at home, after their own rude and accustomable manner. And this I observed, in my traversing the whole kingdom, I never saw one or other, neither could move any of that nation to pledge or present his Majesty's health; but as many other healths as you please, they will both fasten and receive from you, till they fall in the muddy *hotch*-potch of their dead grandfathers understanding. Indeed for entertainment of strangers, they are freely disposed; and there gentlemen of any good sort, reserve ever in their houses Spanish sack, and Irish **uscova**, and will be as tipsy with their wives, their priests, and their friends, as though they were naturally infeoft in the eleven royal taverns of Naples.


*Two intolerable abuses in Ireland.* And now, amongst many, there are two intolerable abuses of protections in that kingdom; the one of thieves and wood-**carns**, the other of priests and Papists. I discourse of these corruptions now as I found them then.[3](javascript:footNote('E610003-001/note003.html'))

p.409


The first is prejudicial to all Christian civility, tranquil government, and a great discouragement for our colonised planters there, belonging to both soils of this island, being daily molested, and nightly incumbered, with these blood-sucking rebels.


And notwithstanding of their barbarous cruelty, ever executed at all advantages, with slaughter and murder upon the Scots and English dwellers there[4](javascript:footNote('E610003-001/note004.html')), yet they



---

p.410




have, and find at their own wills, simonaical protections, for lesser or longer times; ever as the confused disposers have their law-sold hands filled with the bloody bribes of slaughtered lives, highway and house robbed people. And then thereafter, their ill-got means being spent, like unto dogs, they return back to their former vomit; so juggling with their in and out goings, like to the restless ocean, that they cannot, nor ever did, become true subjects to our King, nor faithful friends to their country.*The filthy corruption of Irish priests and wood-carns, thievish rebels.* Unless, by extremity of justice, the one still hanged before the other, the remnant by the gallows may exemplify amendment, contrariwise, that land shall never be quiet: for these villanous wood-**carns** are but the hounds of their hunting priests, against what faction soever their malicious malignity is intended; partly for entertainment, partly for particular spleens, and lastly for a general disturbance of the country, for the priests greater security and stay.


The other abuse is, their libertinous masses; the redress whereof, I first to the heavens, and then to my prince bequeath; whose sabbath recusant money, whereof they brag, (as they say), in derision of our luke-warm dispensation, tendeth to none other purpose, but to obumbrate the true light of the gospel, and to feed their absurd and almost irrevocable ignorance.


And nevertheless, at their daily meetings, (experience taught me), there was never a more repining people against our prince and church as they be: for in this presumption a two-fold cause ariseth, want of zeal, and church discipline on our part, and the officious nine-penny mass on their part; yea, all and each of them, so exacted and compounded with at higher or lower rates, as the officers in this nature please.


The distribution whereof I no wise parallel to the flight concaviating veins of the earth, nor the sole supply of high-rising Atlas, neither to envelop the perpendiculars of long-reaching Caucasus; howsoever demolished

p.411




churches, impassable bridges, indigent scholars, and distressed families, be supported therewith, I am as clear of it as they, although I smart by the contrary confusion.


*A bad and uncivil husbandry in Ireland.* But leaving this, and observing my method, I remember I saw in the north parts of Ireland two remarkable sights; the one was their manner of tillage, ploughs drawn by horse-tails, wanting garnishing, they are only fastened with straw, or wooden ropes, to their bare rumps, marching all side for side, three or four in a rank, and as many men hanging by the ends of that untoward labour. It is as bad a husbandry, I say, as ever I found among the wildest savages alive; for Caramines, who understand not the civil form of agriculture, yet they delve, hollow, and turn over the ground, with manual and wooden instruments. But the Irish have thousands of both kingdoms daily labouring beside them; yet they cannot learn, because they will not learn, to use garnishing, so obstinate they are in their barbarous customs, unless punishment and penalties were inflicted; and yet most of them are content to pay twenty shillings a-year, before they will change their custom.


*Northern Irish women giving suck to their babes behind their shoulders.* The other as goodly sight I saw was women traveling or toiling at home, carrying their infants about their necks, and laying their dugs over their shoulders, would give suck to the babes behind their backs, without taking them in their arms. Such kind of breasts, methinketh, were very fit to be made money-bags for East or West Indian merchants, being more than half a yard long, and as well wrought as any tanner, in the like charge, could ever mollify such leather.


As for any other customs they have, to avoid prolixity, I spare: only, before my pen fly over seas, I would gladly shake hands with some of our churchmen

p.412




there; for better are the wounds of a friend, than the sweet smile of a flatterer; for love and truth cannot dissemble.


Many dissembling impudents intrude themselves in this high calling of God, who are not truly, neither worthily, thereunto called; the ground here arising either from a carnal or careless presumption, otherwise from needy, greedy, and lack of bodily maintenance.


*An ecclesiastic corruption in unlawful preachers.* Such is now the corruption of time, that I know here even mechanic men admitted in the place of pastors; yea, and rude-bred soldiers, whose education was at the musket-mouth, are become there both Libyan grave, and unlearned churchmen; nay, besides them professed, indeed professed scholars, whose warbling mouths, ingorged with spoonfuls of bruised Latin, seldom or never expressed, unless the force of quaffing spew it forth from their empty sculls; such, I say, confine their doctrine between the thatch and the churchwalls tops; and yet their smallest stipends shall amount to one, two, three, or four hundred pounds a year.


Whereupon you may demand me, how spend they or how deserve they this? I answer, Their deserts are nought, and the fruit thereof as naughtily spent; for sermons and prayers they never have any; neither have they ever preached any, nor can preach.


And although some could, as perhaps they seeming would, they shall have no auditor (as they say) but bare walls, the plants of their parishes being the roots of mere Irish. As concerning their carriage in spending such sacrilegious fees, the course is thus.


The alehouse is their church, the Irish priests their conforts; their auditors be, Fill and fetch more; their text Spanish sack, their prayers carousing, their singing of psalms whiffing of tobacco, their last blessing aqua vitae, and all their doctrine found drunkenness.

p.413


*A flattering covenant betwixt ministers and mass-priests.* And whensoever these parties do meet, their parting is Dane-like, from a Dutch pot, and the minister, still purse-bearer, defrayeth all charges for the priest. Arguments of religion, like Podolian Polonians, they succumb; their conference only pleading mutual forbearance; the minister afraid of the priest's wood-**carns**, and the priests as fearful of the minister's apprehending or denoting them; contracting thereby by Gibeonized covenant; yea, and for more submission's sake, he will give way to the priest to mumble mass in his church, where in all his life he never made prayer nor sermon.


Lo there are some of the abuses of our late weak and straggling ecclesiastics there, and the soul-sunk sorrow of godless epicures and hypocrites.


To all which, and much more, have I been an ocular testator, and sometimes a constrained consociate to their companionry; yet not so much inforced, as desirous to know the behaviour and conversation of such mercenary Jebusites.


Great God amend it, for it is great pity to behold it; and if it continue so still, as when I saw them last, O far better it were, that these ill-bestowed tithes, and church-wall rents, were distributed to the poor and needy, than to suffocate the swine-fed bellies of such idle and profane parasites.


And here another general abuse I observed, that whensoever any Irish die, the friend of the defunct (besides other fees) paying twenty shillings to the English curate, shall get the corpse of the deceased to be buried within the church, yea often even under the pulpit-foot; and for lucre, interred in God's sanctuary when dead, who, when alive, would never approach nor enter the gates of Sion, to worship the Lord, nor conform themselves to true religion.


Truly such, and the like abuses, and evil examples of lewd lives, have been the greatest hindrance of that land's conversion; for such, like wolves, have been from

p.414




time to time, but stumbling blocks before them; regarding more their own sensual and licentious ends, than the glory of God, in converting of one soul unto his church.


*Ministerial offices strangely abused.* Now as concerning the unconscionable carriage of the Irish clergy, ask me, and there my reply. As many of them (for the most part) as are Protestant ministers, have their wives, children, and servants invested Papists; and many of these churchmen at the hour of their death, like dogs return back to their former vomit. Witness the late Vicar of Calin (belonging to the late and last **Richard Earl of Desmond**, who being on his deathbed, and having two hundred pounds a year; finding himself to forsake both life and stipend, sent straight for a Romish priest, and received the Popish sacrament: confessing freely in my hearing, that he had been a Roman-catholic all his life, dissembling only with his religion, for the better maintaining of his wife and children. And being brought to the burial-place, he was interred in the church, with which he had played the ruffian all his life; being openly carried at mid-day with Jesuits, priests, and friars of his own nation, and after a contemptible manner, in derision of our profession, and laws of the kingdom.


Infinite more examples of this kind could I recite, and the like resemblances of some being alive; but I respectfully suspend, (wishing a reformation of such deformity), and so concludeth their clerical corruption there. Yet I would not have the reader to think, that I condemn all our clergy there; no, God forbid; for I know there are many sound and religious preachers of both kingdoms among them, who make conscience of their calling, and live as lanthorns to incapable ignorants, and to those straggling Stoicks I complain of condemnatory judges; for it is a grevious thing to see incapable men to juggle with the high mysteries of man's salvation.
