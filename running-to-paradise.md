### Running to Paradise: Author: William Butler Yeats

p.49


1. As I came over Windy Gap
  
They threw a halfpenny into my cap,
  
For I am running to Paradise;
  
And all that I need do is to wish
  
And somebody puts his hand in the dish
  
To throw me a bit of salted fish:
  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.
2. My brother Mourteen is worn out
  
With skelping his big brawling lout,
  
And I am running to Paradise;
  
A poor life do what he can,
  
And though he keep a dog and a gun,
  
A serving maid and a serving man:
  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.

5. Poor men have grown to be rich men,
  
And rich men grown to be poor again,
  
And I am running to Paradise;
  
And many a darling wit's grown dull
  
That tossed a bare heel when at school,
  
Now it has filled an old sock full:
  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.
6. The wind is old and still at play
  
While I must hurry upon my way,
  
For I am running to Paradise;
  
Yet never have I lit on a friend
  
To take my fancy like the wind
  
That nobody can buy or bind:
  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.
