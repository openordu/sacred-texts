The Slaying of Niall of the Nine Hostages, son of Echu Mugmedon, by the hand of Echu, son of Enna Censelach, who sent an arrow at him out of a Saxon camp among the bards of the Pict-folk at Carn Fiell.

p.89


Once Echu, the son of Enna, went from the house of Niall southward to his own land. Then it befel that in order to ask for food he went to the house of Niall's poet. That was Laidcenn, son of Bairchid, the chief-poet of Niall. The young man was refused hospitality by the poet.Then the same Echu came again from the south, destroyed the stronghold of the poet, and killed his only son, even Leat, son of Laidcenn. Thereupon for a whole year the poet kept satirising and lampooning the men of Leinster and cursing them, so that neither grass nor corn grew with them, nor a leaf, to the end of a year.Then Niall went to Leinster upon a hosting, and he said that he would not go from them so long as he was alive, or until
Echu were given him as a pledge and hostage. And this had needs to be done. So he was taken to Ath Fadat[1](javascript:footNote('T302003/note001.html')) in Fothairt Fea[2](javascript:footNote('T302003/note002.html')) on the bank of the Slaney, and was left there before Niall, with a chain around his neck, and the end of the chain through the hole of a stone pillar. Nine champions advance towards him to slay him. ‘Woe!’ said Echu, ‘this is bad indeed!’ With that he gave himself a twist, so that the chain broke in two. He seized the iron bolt that was through the chain, and advanced to meet them. He plied the bolt on them so that the nine fell. The men turn before him down the hill. Those of Leinster pursued them and slaughtered them, so that they fell.Thereupon Niall came southward once more and reached Inis Fail.[3](javascript:footNote('T302003/note003.html')) ‘A guarantee shall be given from the men of Leinster,’ said Laidcenn, ‘and let Echu come that he may be seen by us at this river for so long as a cow is being milked.’[4](javascript:footNote('T302003/note004.html')) ‘Let it be done!’ said Echu. Then his arms are taken away from him. The poet begins to revile the men of Leinster and Echu, so that they melted away before him.[5](javascript:footNote('T302003/note005.html')) As he was reviling them, the youth let fly at

him a champion's stone which he had in his belt, so that it hit the crown of his forehead and lodged in his skull. Thus was that Laidcenn killed. Whence the quatrain was sung:

> 1. A champion's handstone—'t is well known—
>   
>  was hurled into ...
>   
> Echu son of Enna threw it
>   
> at Laidcenn the son of Bairchid.
> 

After having raided Leinster, Niall went home, and Echu was exiled from Ireland so long as Niall reigned. He went until
he came to the house of Erc, the son of Echu Munremar.Niall, however, went to obtain kingship as far as Letha[6](javascript:footNote('T302003/note006.html')) and Italy, and he was called ‘of the Nine Hostages’ because he had five hostages of Ireland, and one hostage each from Scotland and from the Saxons, the Britons and the Franks. Inde dicitur:

> 1. Echu's son of high dignity,
>   
> noble Niall, fiercest shout,
>   
> Seized the sway of kingship
>   
> of Erin and of Alba.
> 2. He had a hostage from each province
>   
> throughout the land of Erin,
>   
> he brought to his will without severance
>   
> four hostages out of Alba.
> 3. Hence he was called
>   
> among the hosts of battlesome warriors,
>   
> In the row of bountiful kings,
>   
> combative Niall of the Nine Hostages.

Now, when they came to the Alps, there was a great river before them, to wit, the Loire of the Alps. They were unable
to cross it, and sat down on its banks. As they were there, they saw a single warrior coming towards them. A crimson five-folded
cloak was about him. In his hands he held two five-pronged spears. A bent rimmed shield with a boss of gold was on him. On
his belt hung a tusk-hilted sword. His hair was in plaits over his back. ‘Welcome to the hero whom we do not know!’ said Niall.
‘It is for that we have come,’ said he. ‘What is it for which thou hast come?’ said Niall. ‘I have come from the Romans to have
speech with thee,’ said he, ‘and this day fortnight their hostages will come to thee. Until they come here am I as a preliminary[7](javascript:footNote('T302003/note007.html'))
hostage for thee’.Others say that their hostages were trysted to the house of Erc, son of Echu Munremar, the King of Alba, and that it is there he was killed among the bards of the Pict-folk as he was exhibiting his shape to them. Or that it may have been the maidens of the Franks who desired him to exhibit his shape.

p.91


Then Erc went towards the assembly, ‘I shall go with thee,’ said Echu, ‘to see my brother in his royal seat before the men of the world.’ When they had arrived, Erc said: ‘That is he yonder!’ There was a glen between them. Without the knowledge of Erc, Echu shot[8](javascript:footNote('T302003/note008.html')) an arrow from the bow, so that the King fell dead from that single shot. Thereupon the Franks attacked the Gaels, and the men of Alba stood by the latter for the sake of their kinship. So they came to Ireland, carrying the body of their king with them. And seven battles were broken before the face of the dead king.[9](javascript:footNote('T302003/note009.html'))It was Torna the poet, of the Ciarraige Luachra, who had fostered Niall. Now, when he heard the report that his foster-
son had been slain, it is then his foster-brother Tuirn, son of Torna, said:

> **Tuirn**1. When we used to go to the gathering
>   
> with the son of Echu Mugmedon,
>   
> As yellow as the primrose was the hair
>   
> upon the head of Cairenn's son.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 


(Cairenn the curly-black, daughter of Sachell Balb, of the Saxons, was the mother of Niall.)
Said his foster-mother:


> **Foster-mother**1. His white teeth, his red lips,
>   
> ... under anger,
>   
> His shape like a fiery blaze
>   
> surmounting warlike Erin.
> 2. The hue of his cheeks at all times,
>   
> even and symmetrical as they were,
>   
> Like the foxglove, like a calf's blood—a feast without a flaw!
>   
> like the top-branches of a forest in May.
> 3. Like the moon, like the sun,
>   
> like a firebrand was the splendour of Niall,
>   
> Like a dragon-ship froin the wave without a fault
>   
> was Niall, the son of Echu Mugmedon.
> 4. This is a yarnful music,
>   
> the wail of every mouth in Kerry:
>   
> It brings grief upon us in our house
>   
> for the death of Niall, grandson of Muredach.
> 
> **Torna**1. 'T was great delight, 't was great ease 
>   
> to be in the company of my dear foster-son,[10](javascript:footNote('T302003/note010.html'))
>   
> When with the son of Echu—'t was no small thing!—
>   
> we used to go to the gathering.

They say, however, that grief for Niall carried off Torna. By a man of Leinster,[11](javascript:footNote('T302003/note011.html')) then, that man was killed. Inde dicitur:


> 1. Niall, Echu's son, great in fight—
>   
> Erin and Alba are in affliction[12](javascript:footNote('T302003/note012.html'))
>   
> He through whom a swift Saxon arrow was put
>   
> by Echu, the son of glorious Enna.
> 

That is the Death of Niall, son of Echu, and of Laidcenn, son of Bairchcda, by tlie hand of Echu, son of Enna Censelach.
