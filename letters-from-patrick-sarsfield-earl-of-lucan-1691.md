—**Limerick**, October 8, *16*91.
Sir, —Be pleased to get **general Ginkel**'s pass for the under-named officers to go into the country to dispose of what effects they left there, and to return with their arms, equipage, and servants, and you will oblige, sir, your most humble servant, —Lucan.

To baron de Ginkel
------------------


October 17th, *16*91.
My lord,—I am extremely surprised to meet with the difficulties **count Nassau** makes as to the embarkment of the wives and children belonging to our troops, which he says is done by your excellency's order. I suppose, if so, it must be by some misconstruction, for it was at all times agreed to by your excellency and the justices without any difficulty, that the women and children belonging to our men should be permitted to be *shipped* with them if they pleased. And the first article does expressly provide that all manner of persons whatsoever that were willing should go for **France**. And what the **count de **Nassau**** objects out of the seventh article, which mentions only the transportation of the troops, that article relates to the number of ships to be provided and tonnage of them, and does by no means cut off or bar the former article. And I am confident, upon serious reflection, your excellency will be of the same opinion. As we have hitherto proceeded of both sides with sincerity and candour, so we, relying upon your excellency's honour and the *public* faith, expect now to be dealt withal without wresting or extorting any meaning out of the articles contrary to agreement and the genuine sense, which fair manner of proceeding will add to the reputation of your arms that of your justice. My lord, the **count de **Nassau****, notwithstanding that I consented to have a second examination of our men as they marched out of **Limerick**, does expect to have another examination here, although by the articles there was to be but one. I shall, therefore, desire your excellency to send your orders that none such be demanded, it being contrary to all agreed. As for the troops that were in **Kerry** and this side of the **Shannon**, in regard the review of those was put off to **Cork** by **major-general Talmach** and me, if your excellency pleases, let those be examined by the **count de **Nassau**** here. My lord, pray despatch your orders about these matters, for, until these obstacles are removed, the troops cannot

embark, and the troops of **Limerick** cannot come away before. I am confident this of the **count de **Nassau**** is a mistaking of your order, for I never can suspect that one of your honour and integrity would break articles so solemnly made. As delay in this matter is inconvenient for you and us, I shall beg you to despatch your orders to the **count de **Nassau**** about these matters, and that **count Nassau** be likewise ordered to provide quarters for our embarkment, for the convenient quarters for the embarkment are taken up by the troops.


This occasion, my lord, does only give me an opportunity to assure your excellency that I am, with all respect imaginable, your excellency's most humble servant, —

Lucan.
