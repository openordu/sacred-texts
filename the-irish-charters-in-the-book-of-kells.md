### The Irish Charters in the Book of Kells


The following Irish deeds are printed from the splendid MS. of the Gospels called the Book of Kells, preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, which, there is every reason to believe, was executed in the time of St. Columbkille. It would be out of place here to attempt a description of this MS., or to put together the evidences of its antiquity. It must suffice to observe, that the existence of the following charters, which have been copied into it, is sufficient to connect it with the monastery of Kells; and that it was in existence there in the year 1006, and then regarded as one of the most splendid relics of the western world, will appear from the following entry in the Annals of Ulster, under that year:


Anno Domini M[ordm ].ui[ordm ] (alias 1007) Soiscelae Mor Coluim Cille do dubgait is ind aidhci as ind iardom iartharach in daim liac moir Cenannsa. Prim mind iarthair domain ar ai in comdaigh doendai. In soscela-sin do foghbail dia fichet adaig ar dib misaib iar ngait de a oir, & fot tairis.


Anno Domini 1006 (alias 1007) The great Gospel of Columb-kille was sacrilegiously stolen by night out of the western porticus of the great church of Kells. This was the chief relic of the western world on account of the singular cover. This Gospel was found in twenty nights and two months, with its gold stolen off, and a sod over it.[1](javascript:footNote('G102003/note001.html'))

Charter of Ballyheerin with its Mill, and Ballycowan with its Mill.
-------------------------------------------------------------------


The family of Kells have granted for the support of pilgrims,[3](javascript:footNote('G102003/note003.html')) Ardcanna,[4](javascript:footNote('G102003/note004.html')) i.e. Baile Ui Uidhrin,[5](javascript:footNote('G102003/note005.html')) with its mill, and with all its land, and Baile Ui Chomhgain,[6](javascript:footNote('G102003/note006.html')) with all its land, and with its mill, to God, and to Columbkille, and to the Bishop o'Cellaigh, the senior of all the men of Meath, and to Maelmuire O'Robhartaigh, head of the Disert,[7](javascript:footNote('G102003/note007.html')) on the third isle of the Ides of November, the feast of Martin, in the year when the kine and swine of Ireland perished by a pestilence. Here are the chiefs who made this grant, namely, Muredhach O'Clucain, abbot of Kells; Conaing O'Breslen, the priest; Guaire O'Clucain, the lector; Aedh, the son of Mac Rechtogan, the vice-erenagh. In the presence of many distinguished laymen, (i.e.) in the presence of Tiernan O'Rourke, King of the men of all Breifny;[8](javascript:footNote('G102003/note008.html')) Godfrey O'Reilly, King of Machaire Gaileng, and Ade O'Hara; and in the presence of the sons of O'Rourke, Donnchadh, and Sitric, these two townlands, in Luighne, of Connaught, were granted.


The Disert of Kells[9](javascript:footNote('G102003/note009.html')) *is granted* to pious pilgrims for ever. Whatever layman or clergyman shall oppose this grant, he shall be accursed of Columbkille, and Finan, and the clergy of Ireland, and of the Christian Church in general.

The king of Tara has granted,[10](javascript:footNote('G102003/note010.html')) that is, Maelsechnaill,[11](javascript:footNote('G102003/note011.html')) son of Conchobhar[12](javascript:footNote('G102003/note012.html')) O'Maelsechnaill, and the comharba *successor* of Columbkille, that is, Domhnall Mac Robhartaigh,[13](javascript:footNote('G102003/note013.html')) with all the ecclesiastics of Kells, in like manner, both priest, and bishop, and professor; also the vice-erenagh has granted, that is, Cormac Mac Rechtogain,[14](javascript:footNote('G102003/note014.html')) with young clerics of the congregation of Columbkille in like manner; these have all granted for ever Disert-Columbkille in Kells, with its vegetable garden, to God and pious pilgrims; no pilgrim having any lawful possession in it at any time until he devotes his life to God, and is devout.


These are the guarantees and securities given for securing *the grant* of this Disert, viz. the clergy of Kells themselves, with their abbot; the King of Meath, that is, Maelsechnaill, the son of Conchobhar O'Maelsechnaill, with the kings and chieftains of Meath in like manner; Donnchadh,[15](javascript:footNote('G102003/note015.html')) the son of Art[16](javascript:footNote('G102003/note016.html')) O'Rourke, King of Connaught and Galeng,[17](javascript:footNote('G102003/note017.html')) the Garbhanach[18](javascript:footNote('G102003/note018.html')) O'Corran,[19](javascript:footNote('G102003/note019.html')) with the young lords of Galeng in like manner; in the presence of the King of Cashel of the Kings,

p.133




that is Donnchadh, the son of Carthach, descendant of Ceallachan of Cashel, this grant of Disert was confirmed.


The blessing of Jesus Christ and of Columbkille, with all the saints of heaven and earth, upon every one who shall increase the respect and veneration of this grant. But a curse and a misfortune from God and his saints upon the person who shall oppose the respect and veneration of this grant. The blessing of the living God and of all the just upon the king, the abbot, and the congregation who confirmed this Disert to God and his pious *pilgrims*. A prayer for Mac Maras Trogh, who wrote the freedom and the confirmation of this Disert to God and his pious *pilgrims*.

The freedom of Ard Breacain [85](javascript:footNote('G102003/note085.html')) granted by the King of Ireland, i.e. Muirchertach O'Lochlainn, and by Diarmaid O'Maelsechlainn, King of Meath, and by the King of Loeghaire,[86](javascript:footNote('G102003/note086.html')) Aedh,[87](javascript:footNote('G102003/note087.html')) the son of Cu Uladh[88](javascript:footNote('G102003/note088.html')) O'Caenulbhain.

O'Lochlainn, King of Ireland, and Diarmaid O'Maelsechlain, King of Meath, induced the King of Loeghaire to sell this night's **coinmhe** for ever, for three ounces of gold. The church, therefore, with its territory and lands, is free, for two reasons, viz. on account of the general freedom of all churches, and on account of this purchase. And Ard Brecain is thus by all means separated from the Loegrians. These are the guarantees

Observations on the foregoing Charters.
---------------------------------------


The foregoing Charters are of a date some centuries later than that of the Book of Kells itself, in which they are found; and it will be necessary to distinguish between the date of the Charters, i.e. of the contracts to which they relate, and of the copies now extant in the Book of Kells, which were probably transcribed from the original deeds into this sacred and venerable book in order to secure their preservation. The ink has in many places so faded that several words are illegible; and this appears to have been the case even in the time of Ussher, who had faithful transcripts of the first six of them made into a paper book, now preserved amongst his manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin (E. 3. 8.) These transcripts, although not always accurate, have preserved some words which have since been destroyed by the bookbinder.


That the hand-writing of these documents, as they are now found in the Book of Kells, is not coeval with the persons whose names are mentioned in them, is evident from the fact that they appear to have been transcribed, at the same time, whereas it is quite obvious that Nos. 2 and 4 are at least half a century older than No. 1. The period at which they were transcribed into this book may be conjectured from the character of the writing and the contractions, which would appear to belong to the latter part of the twelfth century; but the dates of the deeds themselves can be pretty accurately fixed, from the notices of the deaths of the parties concerned, which are recorded in the Irish Annals, and will be given in the following remarks.


These Charters are exceedingly interesting to the historian, as proving that the ancient Irish had committed their covenants to writing in their own language before the Anglo-Norman invasion;



---

p.151




and that their chiefs, though not succeeding according to the law of primogeniture, claimed the right of binding their successors to covenants lawfully made by them—a right which Shane O'Neill and others called in question in the sixteenth century.


The other extant Charters made in Ireland at the same period are very few indeed, and are all in the Latin language. They are 1. The Charter of the foundation of the Abbey of Newry, granted about the year 1160, by Muirchertach or Mauritius Mac Loughlin, monarch of Ireland, by consent of his nobles.[122](javascript:footNote('G102003/note122.html')) 2. The Charter of the foundation of the Cisterician abbey of Rossglass, Monastereven, by O'Dempsey, about the year 1178.[123](javascript:footNote('G102003/note123.html')) 3. The Charter of foundation of the Augustinian monastery of Ferns by Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster, previously to his having invited the English to invade Ireland, that is, about the year 1161.[124](javascript:footNote('G102003/note124.html')) 4. The foundation Charter of the Priory of All Saints on Hoggin Green in 1166.[125](javascript:footNote('G102003/note125.html'))


How early the ancient Irish began to commit their contracts and convenants to writing has not yet been determined, nor indeed made a subject of inquiry by any one qualified to arrive at just conclusions. If we may credit the compiler of the Book of Ballymote, Cathaoir Mor, monarch of Ireland, who died in the year of Christ 128, made a long last will and testament, which this compiler has transcribed, and which would puzzle any lawyer in Christendom to



---

p.152




explain. We have also copies of the testamentary precepts of Moran Mac Main, who was chief Brehon to the Irish monarch Feradach the Just, in the first century. But without insisting on the authenticity of these predictions, we may clearly infer from some entries in the Book of Armagh that deeds of contract and even of sale of lands were committed to writing from the earliest ages of Christianity in Ireland. It is more than probable that hundreds of such deeds were preserved in the Irish monasteries, but it must be confessed that very few of them are now known to our antiquarians, if indeed they have survived the ravages of time.

The Irish annals do not record the exact date of the 'perishing of the kine and swine of Ireland by a pestilence' within the century to which the Charter must be referred; but from the records in those Annals of the deaths of the persons mentioned in the Charter, it is certain that it must have been executed before A.D. 1140, in which year the death of Bishop O'Ceallaigh or O'Kelly is recorded by the Four Masters in the following words:


'A.D. 1140. Eochaid O'Kelly, head of the men of Meath, the most venerable bishop in all Ireland, died at an advanced age at Durrow Columbkille.'


See also Harris, in his edition of Ware's Bishops, says:


'Eochaid O'Kelly, Archbishop of the men of Meath, is mentioned in the anonymous Annals to have died in the year 1140.'[126](javascript:footNote('G102003/note126.html'))


The next named in this document of whom any notice is preserved in the Irish annals is Muredhach O'Clucain, Abbot of Kells, whose death is entered in the Annals of the Four Masters at the year 1154. The periods of some of the more distinguished lay chieftains



---

p.153




mentioned can also be well ascertained, as that of Tiernan O'Rourke, 'King of the men of all Breifny.' This is the celebrated O'Rourke whose wife eloped with Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster, in the year 1152, an event which is supposed to have been the original cause of the English invasion. This Tiernan makes his first appearance in Irish history in the year 1128, when he insulted and assaulted Celsus, Archbishop of Armagh, and killed some of his clergy, from which period forward he figures as one of the most conspicuous of the Irish chieftains till the year 1172, when he is slain on the hill of Tlachtgha, near Athboy, by Griffin, a nephew of Maurice Fitzgerald.


The next chief is Godfrey or Geoffrey O'Reilly. According to the Annals of the Four Masters he was banished into Connaught in the year 1154 by Murchertach O'Loughlin or Mac Loughlin, King of the north of Ireland, and was slain at Kells in the year 1161, by Melaghlin O'Rourke.


From these dates we may safely conclude that this document cannot be older than the year 1128, nor later than 1140, in which the venerable Bishop O'Kelly died.


No. 2—Page 139
--------------


The date of this Charter may be pretty accurately fixed from the notices of the more distinguished persons therein mentioned, preserved by the Irish annalists. The death of Maelsechnaill or Maelseachlainn, the son of Conchobar O'Maelseachnaill, King of Tara, is entered in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1087, as follows:


'A.D. 1087. Maelseachlainn, son of Conchobhar O'Maelseachlainn, King of Tara, was killed in treachery and guile by Cathal Mac Muiricen and the men of Teffia, at Ardagh of the Bishop Mel.'

p.154


Domhnall Mac Robhartaigh, the Comharba or successor of St. Columbkille at Kells, died, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, in the year 1098. His name occurs in the inscription on the celebrated relic called the Cathach of St. Columbkille, now deposited in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy.


Donnchadh, the son of Art O'Rourke, King of Connaught, mentioned as one of the guarantees and securities of the grant to which this deed relates, was killed, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, in the battle of Moin Cruinneoige, on the 4th of the Calends of November, in the year 1084. The O'Briens carried away his head in truimph to Limerick, but it was recovered in 1088 by Donnell Mac Loughlin, King of Aileach.


Donnchadh, the son of Carthach, 'King of Cashel of the Kings,' and descendant of Callaghan-Cashel, was the brother of Muireadhach, the ancestor of the Mac Carthys. He is called King of Cashel in the interpolated Dublin copy of the Annals of Innisfallen, in which it is stated that he was slain by Callaghan O'Callaghan in the year 1092; but in the Annals of the Four Masters, which mention his death at the same year, he is called King of Eoghanacht Chaisil. The relationship of this Donnchadh to Callaghan O'Callaghan, by whom he was slain, will appear from the following table: *See accompanying pdf.*

p.155


It follows, therefore, that the year 1084 is the latest date that can be assigned to the Charter before us.


No. 3—Page 132
--------------


The date of this Charter is fixed to the latter part of the eleventh century by our knowledge of the obits of three of the persons mentioned in it, namely, O'Clucain, Comharba of Kells; the Bishop O'Dunan; and Donnell, the son of Flann, King of Tara. According to the Annals of Ulster and the Four Masters, Ferdomhnach O'Clucain, Comharba of Kells, died in the year 1114. The death of Maelmuire O'Dunan, archbishop, is entered in the Annals of Ulster, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the interpolated copy of the Annals of Innisfallen, at the year 1117; but they differ as to the name of his see. The Four Masters call him Archbishop of Munster, and the Annals of Innisfallen Archbishop of Ireland. The old translation of the Annals of Ulster makes mention of two prelates of this name who died in 1117, namely 'Maolmure O'Dunan, chief Bishop of the Irish, and head of Ireland, clergy and laitye, for almes', &; and 'Maolmure O'Dunan, Archbishop of Munster.' In Mageoghegan's translation of the Annals of Clonmacnoise, at the year 1100, where an account is given of a synod held that year at Cashel, he is called 'O'Downan, arch Bushopp and Elder of Ireland.' In Harris's edition of Ware's Bishops, p. 467, 'Miler or Melmury O'Dunan, Archbishop of Cashel, is said to have died at Clonard, on the 24th of December, 1118, in the 77th year of his age.' And again, in the list of the Bishops of Meath, p. 140, 'Idunan, called Bishop of Meath, is said to have flourished in 1096.' The fact would appear to be that there was but one O'Dunan, and that he was Bishop of Meath, and that 'head of the clergy of Ireland for almes,' has been understood as meaning archbishop, when, in reality, it means nothing more



---

p.156




than 'the most charitable bishop.' Were he Bishop or Archbishop of Cashel he would not be styled Senior of Leth Cuinn in this document, but of Leth Mhoga; the former being the ancient name for the norther, and the latter for the southern half of Ireland.


According to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, and the Four Masters, Domhnall or Donnell, the son of Flann, King of Tara, mentioned in this deed, was King of Meath, and was deposed and slain by his own people in the year 1094. It must, therefore, follow, that this document was drawn up sometime previous to that year.


No. 4—Page 136
--------------


Nothing remains to determine the age of this document but the name of Amhalgaidh, Comharba of Patrick, who became Archbishop of Armagh in the year 1021, and died in 1050. There were many Kings of Meath of the O'Melaghlin family named Conchobar or conor, the son of Domhnall, who is mentioned in the Annals of Ulster, of Clonmacnoise and of the Four Masters, as having blinded his brother Flann in the year 1037.


The death of a Maelmuire O h-Uchtain, Comharba of Kells, is entered in the Annals of the Four Masters at tthe year 1008, but the person referred to in this document must have been a later namesake of his who flourished in or after the year 1021, when Amhalgaidh became Comharba or successor of St. Patrick. But of this second Maelmuire the Irish annalists have preserved no notice.


No. 5—Page 140
--------------


The names of the sureties mentioned in this deed do not occur in the Irish annals, but the date of the document may be inferred from that of No. 7, where it appears that Guaire O'Clucain, the

Lector of Kells, was contemporary with the son of Imar III., King of the Danes of Dublin.


No. 6—Page 142
--------------


The date of this document can be fixed to about the middle of the twelfth century by the notices of the more illustrious persons therein mentioned, namely, Muirchertach O'Loughlin; Dermot O'Melaghlin; Gilla-mac-Liag, Comharba of St. Patrick; and Edru O'Miadhachain, Bishop of Meath.


¶1] Muirchertach O'Loughlin was monarch of Ireland 'without opposition,' in the year 1161, about which time he granted a Charter to the monastery of Newry. He was slain in the year 1166.


¶2] Dermot O'Melaghlin was contemporary with the monarch Muirchertach O'Loughlin, and survived him several years. He was appointed King of Meath in the year 1157 by the Synod of Mellifont, in the place of his brother Donnchadh, who was excommunicated by the same Synod.


¶3] Gilla-mac-Liag, or Gelasius, Comharba of Patrick, was Archbishop of Armagh. He succeeded in the year 1137, and died in 1174.


¶4] Edru O'Miadhachain, Bishop of Meath, succeeded in 1150, and died in 1173 or 1174. He assisted at the Synod of Kells in 1152.


From these historical notices it is evident that this document cannot be older than the year 1157, when Dermot O'Melaghlin became King of Meath, nor more modern than 1174, when Archbishop Gilla-mac-Liag, or Gelasius, died.


No. 7—Page 147
--------------


The date of this document may probably be fixed by the close of the eleventh century, if Maelbrigit O Cenan be mentioned in it, which

is certainly doubtful, for the word is almost illegible, and the letters máelbrig   
[*...*]  
 nan are all that can with certainty be read. He was killed, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, in 1117. The son of Imar, with whom Scully O'Lavery, one of the sureties, was contemporary, was probably Sitric, son of Imar or Ifars, third King of the Danes of Dublin, who flourished about the year 1050.
