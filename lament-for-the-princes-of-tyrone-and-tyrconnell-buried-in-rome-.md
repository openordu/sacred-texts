#### Notes


Mangan's poem is ultimately based on the Irish poem A bhean fuair faill ar a bhfeart composed by Eoghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird c.1608. The English version appeared in the Irish Penny Journal, 17th October 1840. Lord Jeffrey was greatly struck with this poem when he saw it in Duffy's Ballad Poetry of Ireland, 1845. (D.J. O'Donoghue.)

### Lament for the Princes of Tyrone and Tyrconnell (Buried in Rome): Author: James Clarence Mangan




---

p.17


[1](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note001.html'))1. O Woman of the Piercing Wail,
  
Who mournest o'er yon mound of clay
  
With sigh and groan,
  
Would God thou wert among the Gael!
  
Thou wouldst not then from day to day
  
Weep thus alone.
  
'Twere long before, around a grave
  
In green Tirconnell, one could find
  
This loneliness;
  
Near where Beann-Boirche's banners wave
  
Such grief as thine could ne'er have pined
  
Companionless.


---

p.18

4. Beside the wave, in Donegall,
  
In Antrim's glens, or fair Dromore,
  
Or Killilee,
  
Or where the sunny waters fall,
  
At Assaroe, near Erna's shore,
  
This could not be.
  
On Derry's plains—in rich Drumclieff—
  
Throughout Armagh the Great, renowned
  
In olden years,
  
No day could pass but Woman's grief
  
Would rain upon the burial-ground
  
Fresh floods of tears!
5. O, no!—from Shannon, Boyne, and Suir,
  
From high Dunluce's castle-walls,
  
From Lissadill,
  
Would flock alike both rich and poor,
  
One wail would rise from Cruachan's halls
  
To Tara's hill;
  
And some would come from Barrow-side,
  
And many a maid would leave her home
  
On Leitrim's plains,
  
And by melodious Banna's tide,
  
And by the Mourne and Erne, to come
  
And swell thy strains!
6. O, horses' hoofs would trample down
  
The Mount whereon the martyr-saint[2](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note002.html'))
  
Was crucified.
  
From glen and hill, from plain and town,
  
One loud lament, one thrilling plaint,
  
Would echo wide.


---

p.19


There would not soon be found, I ween
  
One foot of ground among those bands
  
For museful thought,
  
So many shriekers of the keen[3](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note003.html'))
  
Would cry aloud, and clap their hands,
  
All woe-distraught!
7. Two princes of the line of Conn
  
Sleep in their cells of clay beside
  
O'Donnell Roe:
  
Three royal youths, alas! are gone,
  
Who lived for Erin's weal, but died
  
For Erin's woe!
  
Ah! could the men of Ireland read
  
The names these noteless burial-stones
  
Display to view,
  
Their wounded hearts afresh would bleed,
  
Their tears gush forth again, their groans
  
Resound anew!
8. The youths whose relics moulder here
  
Were sprung from Hugh, high Prince and Lord
  
Of Aileach's land.
  
Thy noble brothers, justly dear,
  
Thy nephew, long to be deplored
  
By Ulster's bands.
  
Theirs were not souls wherein dull Time
  
Could domicile Decay or house
  
Decrepitude!
  
They passed from earth ere Manhood's prime,
  
Ere years had power to dim their brows
  
Or chill their blood.


---

p.20

11. And who can marvel o'er thy grief,
  
Or who can blame thy flowing tears,
  
That knows their source?
  
O'Donnell, Dunnasava's chief,
  
Cut off amid his vernal years,
  
Lies here a corse
  
Beside his brother Cathbar, whom
  
Tirconnell of the Helmets mourns
  
In deep despair—
  
For valour, truth, and comely bloom,
  
For all that greatens and adorns,
  
A peerless pair.
12. O, had these twain, and he, the third,
  
The Lord of Mourne, O'Niall's son,
  
Their mate in death—
  
A prince in look, in deed, and word—
  
Had these three heroes yielded on
  
The field their breath,
  
O, had they fallen on Criffan's plain,
  
There would not be a town or clan
  
From shore to sea
  
But would with shrieks bewail the Slain,
  
Or chant aloud the exulting rann[4](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note004.html'))
  
Of jubilee!
13. When high the shout of battle rose,
  
On fields where Freedom's torch still burned
  
Through Erin's gloom,
  
If one, if barely one of those
  
Were slain, all Ulster would have mourned
  
The hero's doom!


---

p.21


If at Athboy, where hosts of brave
  
Ulidian horsemen sank beneath
  
The shock of spears,
  
Young Hugh O'Neill had found a grave,
  
Long must the North have wept his death
  
With heart-wrung tears!
14. If on the day of Ballach-myre
  
The Lord of Mourne had met, thus young,
  
A warrior's fate,
  
In vain would such as thou desire
  
To mourn, alone, the champion sprung
  
From Niall the Great!
  
No marvel this—for all the Dead,
  
Heaped on the field, pile over pile,
  
At Mallach-brack,
  
Were scarce an eric[5](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note005.html')) for his head,
  
If Death had stayed his footsteps while
  
On victory's track!
15. If on the Day of Hostages
  
The fruit had from the parent bough
  
Been rudely torn
  
In sight of Munster's bands—Mac-Nee's—
  
Such blow the blood of Conn, I trow,
  
Could ill have borne.
  
If on the day of Ballach-boy
  
Some arm had laid, by foul surprise,
  
The chieftain low,
  
Even our victorious shout of joy
  
Would soon give place to rueful cries
  
And groans of woe!


---

p.22

18. If on the day the Saxon host
  
Were forced to fly—a day so great
  
For Ashanee[6](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note006.html'))—
  
The Chief had been untimely lost,
  
Our conquering troops should moderate
  
Their mirthful glee.
  
There would not lack on Lifford's day,
  
From Galway, from the glens of Boyle,
  
From Limerick's towers,
  
A marshalled file, a long array
  
Of mourners to bedew the soil
  
With tears in showers!
19. If on the day a sterner fate
  
Compelled his flight from Athenree,
  
His blood had flowed,
  
What numbers all disconsolate
  
Would come unasked, and share with thee
  
Affliction's load!
  
If Derry's crimson field had seen
  
His life-blood offered up, though 'twere
  
On Victory's shrine,
  
A thousand cries would swell the keen,
  
A thousand voices in despair
  
Would echo thine!
20. Oh, had the fierce Dalcassian swarm
  
That bloody night on Fergus' banks,
  
But slain our Chief,
  
When rose his camp in wild alarm—
  
How would the triumph of his ranks
  
Be dashed with grief!


---

p.23


How would the troops of Murbach mourn
  
If on the Curlew Mountains' day,
  
Which England rued,
  
Some Saxon hand had left them lorn,
  
By shedding there, amid the fray,
  
Their prince's blood!
21. Red would have been our warriors' eyes
  
Had Roderick found on Sligo's field
  
A gory grave,
  
No Northern Chief would soon arise
  
So sage to guide, so strong to shield,
  
So swift to save.
  
Long would Leith-Cuinn[7](javascript:footNote('E840000-007/note007.html')) have wept if Hugh
  
Had met the death he oft had dealt
  
Among the foe;
  
But, had our Roderick fallen too,
  
All Erin must, alas! have felt
  
The deadly blow!
22. What do I say? Ah, woe is me!
  
Already we bewail in vain
  
Their fatal fall!
  
And Erin, once the Great and Free,
  
Now vainly mourns her breakless chain,
  
And iron thrall!
  
Then, daughter of O'Donnell! dry
  
Thine overflowing eyes, and turn
  
Thy heart aside!
  
For Adam's race is born to die,
  
And sternly the sepulchral urn
  
Mocks human pride!


---

p.24

25. Look not, nor sigh, for earthly throne,
  
Nor place thy trust in arm of clay—
  
But on thy knees
  
Uplift thy soul to God alone,
  
For all things go their destined way
  
As He decrees.
  
Embrace the faithful Crucifix,
  
And seek the path of pain and prayer
  
Thy Saviour trod;
  
Nor let thy spirit intermix
  
With earthly hope and worldly care
  
Its groans to God!
26. And thou, O mighty Lord! whose ways
  
Are far above our feeble minds
  
To understand,
  
Sustain us in these doleful days,
  
And render light the chain that binds
  
Our fallen land!
  
Look down upon our dreary state,
  
And through the ages that may still
  
Roll sadly on,
  
Watch Thou o'er hapless Erin's fate,
  
And shield at least from darker ill
  
The blood of Conn!
