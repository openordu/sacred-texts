### The wandering of Ulixes son of Laertes: Author: [unknown]




---

p.17


After the capture and destruction of the chief 
town of the Trojans and the adventures of 
the Greeks, everyone of these reached his own 
native land and country. Then Ulixes, the son of 
Laertes, also reached his land and country, and saw 
the mountains of his native land before him. ‘It 
is a grievous thing to us what we shall find there—
viz., the beautiful, gentle queen whom we left there, 
with another man before our face, and another king 
over our territory, and our land in his possession, 
and old age on our own form, though it is we by
right.’ ‘Do not let this oppress thee,’ said his 
men to Ulixes, ‘for we shall all find the same evil.’ 
Then a storm fell upon them, and they were again 
driven out into the wet of the open sea, and were 
thus astray for a year, until they came to a large 
island.


And they found great big woolly sheep,
and killed three of them. And they put up their 
tents over them, and placed their fires and prepared



---

p.18




their sheep. Three days and three nights they were 
there. After that Ulixes spoke. ‘It is time for us 
to be starting,’ said he. ‘It is not just what 
thou sayest,’ said they, ‘for here we have our 
fill of food to the day of judgment, in what there 
is here of sheep.’ ‘This,’ he said, ‘I shall 
not do for your sake, to give up seeking to reach 
our native land.’ ‘What thou art seeking,’ said 
they, ‘is that we may all perish in thy track, as all 
thy people were left before this.’


Then they left 
the island, and went again in their ships, and 
were a year on the sea, until they reached another 
island.


When they had gone on that island, they 
found a mountain of gold in its midst. ‘This is 
a good find,’ said his men to Ulixes. ‘How do 
ye know that?’ said he. ‘Did ye not get enough 
treasures out of Troy?’ And they began to 
gather in the gold until they saw the Cyclops 
coming towards them.


 And he did not ask 
tidings of them, but as they were there, so he 
went among them. Where there was a hero or a 
battle-soldier he closed his arms around them, 
and broke and minced their bones and their flesh. 
Then after having killed a great number of them, 
he lifted up nine of them between his two arms, 
together with Ulixes, the son of Laertes. Now 
when Ulixes, the cunning right clever man, perceived
 that he was being carried off by force, he 
escaped between the elbows of his men down to the



---

p.19




ground, and his men were carried away from him.


Then he went to the ships, and related those tidings
to the nine that were in the ships. And his people
said to him: ‘Let us put plenty of treasures in 
our vessels and proceed on our way.’ ‘Not so’
said he, ‘until it is found out how my men are
taken from me ; and it is sad and sore to me that 
they are carried from me.’ ‘Though it is 
sad’, said they, ‘do not say so, for we deem it a 
sufficient honour that thou art among us.’ Then 
Ulixes went to seek the big man; and he came to 
the door of the cave. There he saw the white-faced
sad countenance of his men in the cave looking
out at him. ‘Comrades,’ said he, ‘great is the 
danger in which ye are.’ ‘Thou art right,’ said 
they, ‘and thou thyself wilt be out of it.’ ‘Not 
so,’ said he; ‘not before I and the giant have 
met.’ ‘What dost thou think?’ said they. 
‘What means hast thou to use against him? Thy 
spear is not so sharp nor thy arm so strong that 
the point of thy spear could touch a bone in his 
body.’ ‘Can ye try to rise over him from behind?’ 
said he. ‘Alas!’ said they, ‘there are three 
paces of each man of us between his two nipples.’ 
‘How do ye know,’ said he, ‘that the barbarous 
nature that is in his body may not be a heaviness 
which is easy to overcome when his body is asleep?
Rise over him from behind,’ said he, ‘and raise 
your breaths in the top of your breast to lighten 



---

p.20




yourselves.’ They arose and went out over him, 
and there were three paces of every man of them 
between his two nipples as they stepped over him.
‘Now let us go,’ said they. ‘Not so,’ said he, 
‘not until I and the giant have met.’ He went up 
to him, and into the one big eye that was in the 
front part of his forehead he put the point of his 
spear, between the two brows, and gave a thrust to 
the spear in his eye. And he had a difficult task to 
save himself from the broad and large loch of water 
that burst from it. However, the mountain shook 
and the cave resounded with the beating which the 
huge gigantic man made with his feet and his arms, 
as he sought for him who had done that outrage on 
him. And thereupon they went into their ship.


It is related that a man of the people of Ulixes 
went away, out of a hardy and idle mood, and this 
was the man who met Aeneas, the son of Anchises, 
when he was on his voyage of exile. Now Ulixes 
was one year on the sea after leaving that island, 
and nine of his men only reached land with him, 
while the others found death through an unknown 
malady. Then Ulixes went on shore, and shepherds, 
with their flocks met him. Now that man was very 
cunning, a clever right wise man, sharing in many 
a tongue, for he was wont to learn the tongue of 
every country to which he came, and to ask tidings 
of them in the language that they used. And this 
is what he learnt from them, that the Judge of



---

p.21




Right was lord in that country. ‘What right is
it that serves him ?’ asked Ulixes. ‘Every man
that gets instruction from him, he will reach his 
native land at once,’ said they. ‘Why,’ said 
Ulixes, ‘should not I get instruction from him? ’ 
‘Thou hast not the means;’ said he who spoke 
with him; ‘for a single day's instruction is not 
given without (a payment of) thirty ounces of gold 
to him. And thou,’ said they, ‘who art thou?’
‘One of the fugitives of the Trojans am I,’ said 
he. And he went from them towards his ship.
And his men asked tidings from him.


And he 
related to them as he had heard, and told them 
to get instruction. But they said that they had no 
desire to do so; ‘for our hairs have fallen out, 
and our eyes have grown dim, and our faces have 
become black, and our teeth yellow, and we have 
no great need to give away our gold or our possessions 
for instruction that would be of no use 
to us.’ ‘Which is better for you,’ said he; ‘to 
leave it in the breaches of danger or at the gates of 
death, or to spend it for an instruction which will 
be profitable to you?’ Thereupon they went on their 
way to the fortress, and the man of the place 
met them on the meadow and asked tidings of 
them. And they related to him every hardship 
that they had encountered. And he asked them 
what they had come for. ‘We have come to learn 
from thee.’ ‘Ye will get it, provided ye have the



---

p.22




means for it.’ ‘What at all are the means?’ said 
they. ‘I do not give a single day's instruction without 
thirty ounces of red gold.’ ‘We shall find that 
for thee,’ said they. Then they were made welcome, 
and a separate bed-chamber was given to them, and 
meat and drink was taken into it for them, and all
was got ready for them to bathe and to wash. And 
there they stayed that night.


Early on the morrow they arose and went 
to the place where the Judge of Right was. They 
weighed out thirty ounces of red gold to him, and 
he taught them. And this was the instruction:
‘Though ye nine had but one father and one 
mother amongst you, and though one man had 
killed your father and your mother, yet do ye 
resolve not to kill him before ye have held three
counsels with yourselves about it, and before it is 
certain that ye all are of one mind for ever.
And though it come upon one man of you only, 
nevertheless let him not do the deed until he has 
three times kept his breath and held counsel with 
his own mind. If that then is what his mind will 
bring away from the counsel, then let him do the 
deed.’ ‘Say on,’ said they. ‘No more for 
to-day but this,’ said he. Then they went to their 
house. ‘That gold is thrown away,’ said his men 
to Ulixes. They were there that night, and though 
the attendance they had the first night was good, 
it was better this night. They rose early on the



---

p.23




morrow, and went to the house of the precept.


Thirty ounces of gold were weighed out to him,
and this is what he said : ‘As to the road ye
travel every day, do not follow a by path or short 
cut, but follow the high road.’ ‘Say on,’ 
said they. ‘No more teaching to-day but this,’ 
said he. Then they went to their house. ‘That 
gold is lost,’ said his men to Ulixes. ‘Who 
knows but that ye will find its use?’ said Ulixes.
And though the attendance of the first two nights 
was good, it was better the third night. They 
arose early in the morrow, and went to the house of 
precept. And thirty ounces of red gold were 
weighed out, and this is what he said: ‘Do ye see 
the sun at this moment?’ ‘We do,’ said they.
‘Let none of you leave his place or dwelling, 
how great soever his impatience may be, until the 
sun has reached the place where he is now.’ 
‘Say on,’ said they. ‘No more teaching from 
me this turn, but that,’ said he. ‘And do not 
leave to-morrow before I have talked to you,’ sald 
he. They went to their house, and arose early the 
next morning and went out on the meadow. And
the man met them and bade him farewell, and they 
left their blessing with him. ‘Take with thee,’ 
said the Judge, ‘this small box as a keepsake, and 
if thou open it, thou shalt never again reach thy
native land.’ ‘That is a small reward for us 
after we have reached our country’. And he gave 



---

p.24




them guidance how to reach their country by land.


Thereupon they went on their way, and it is not 
told here how long they were on the road. But 
they reached a great march, and there was a 
public hostelry in that march: into that they went, 
like anybody else. Great numbers came from all 
quarters into that house. Every one of them asked 
the other, ‘What direction are ye going tomorrow?’ 
‘We are going into the border 
country,’ said they. However, the company that 
was in that hostelry arose. They went out from 
the house into the field. Howbeit, Ulixes said:
‘Ill from me have gone my thirty ounces of gold, 
if I would not stay until the sun will rise to the 
place that he told us.’ Then he sat himself down. 
‘What is this?’ said his people to him. ‘I shall 
keep by my instruction,’ said Ulixes. ‘This is 
what thou art seeking,’ said they, ‘that we all may 
perish in thy track; as the men of the eighty ships 
have perished that fell before Troy in thy track, so 
likewise shall we perish in thy track.’ ‘Do ye 
intend to stay?’ said a man of the company.
‘Even so,’ said they. ‘Are ye acquainted with 
the border-land?’ ‘We are not,’ said they. ‘Do 
ye not see the field and the road?’ ‘We do,’ 
said they. ‘Make for those,’ said he, ‘and if 
ye get across, ye will reach your country safe.’


Then that company went on their way, but Ulixes 
with his men waited till the sun had risen to the



---

p.25




place that had been told them. ‘Yonder,’ said 
they, ‘are the first of the company on the road, 
and if we were there now, we should reach home 
safely.’ ‘It seems to me,’ said Ulixes, ‘your 
company is not yet round the field, nor will the
wish be with you on the other side.’


And suddenly they beheld the earth bursting
open under the company, so that they saw not one 
man of them alive. ‘Do ye see that?’ said Ulixes. 
‘We see it,’ said they. ‘Good is the profit of our 
thirty ounces of gold for you; and let us set out
now,’ said he, ‘for They will have dispersed yonder
after the deed.’ Then they went their way on the 
road until they reached the border-land, and came
into a great wilderness. And they did not follow 
a path or road from the highway. Howbeit, two
of his men went out on a bypath, and at once 
found their death. The seven, however, that 
remained reached their native town, and came to 
the bower where the Queen was. And they saw 
her on a great throne upon the firm floor of the 
house, and a youth, the fairest in shape of the heroes 
of the world, at her shoulder. ‘I told you so,’ 
said Ulixes. ‘We must needs brook it,’ said they.
 ‘Ye good men there before me,’ said the Queen, 
whose name was Penelope, ‘who at all are ye?’ 
‘Seafarers astray are we,’ said they. ‘Go,’ said 
she, ‘into the guest-house.’ They were served 
that night till they went to their bed.


‘Do ,ye



---

p.26




know what I should like to do?’ said Ulixes.
‘We know not,’ said they. ‘I had a subterranean 
cave of escape out of the town, and there is one 
entrance to it in the town yonder, with a closing 
door to it, and another entrance on the green 
outside, and the weight of a flagstone upon it.
And what I want to do is to go through the outer door 
along the cave to the other end, until I reach 
their bed-chamber, and the place where they are 
together on the pillow; there will I slay them both 
with my sword.’ ‘Evil is that counsel,’ said they. 
‘But fitter it is for thee to go and seek the King 
of the Greeks, and to lament unto him thy sorrows;
and just as thou didst go in his host, so let him go 
in thine host to contest thy native country for thee.’ 
‘May the gods we worship never allow that!’ 
said Ulixes. Then there was reproach and counter-reproach between his men and him.


‘It is thus we 
have all fallen in thy track,’ said they. Then he 
arose from them to get into the town beyond, and 
he reached the bed-chamber, and heard the conversation of the two on the pillow. And he bared 
his sword on the spot, and raised his arm. ‘Ill 
is the profit of my instruction for me,’ said he, 
‘if I do not first control my nature till I have kept 
my breath.’ Thrice he raised his arm in order to 
strike with the edge of his sword at the neck of 
the two. The third time that he raised his arm
and wanted to do the deed, then spoke the Queen:



---

p.27




‘Uch, uch, oh son,’ said she, ‘thy father has 
appeared to me over our heads, and stoutly he 
was minded to strike off our heads, thinking that 
thou wert my fair leman. I swear by the gods I 
worship,’ said she, ‘that I do not know guilt from 
another man since he went away in the host of the 
Greeks; and he left me pregnant at the time he 
went, and thou wert born from that pregnancy.
And I never let the body of another man into one 
bed with myself, but the blood of him and mine 
own blood have still preserved his honour.’


When Ulixes heard that speech his spirit rejoiced within 
him. Thereupon she arose and wept swift showers 
of tears, and he was listening to her until sleep fell
upon him, even till the end of the night came.
Then he arose and was greatly ashamed of that 
sleep. He went out and lay down among his men 
and told them what had happened. And he gave 
thanks to the gods for it. On the morrow they 
arose and went into the same house. ‘Ye good 
men,’ said the Queen, ‘who at all are ye?’ 
‘Ulixes the son of Laertes am I,’ said he. ‘Thou 
art not the Ulixes that we knew,’ said she. ‘It is 
I in sooth,’ said he; ‘and I shall tell thee my 
tokens,’ said he. And then he went into her 
sweet secrets and their talks together, and the 
things she hid in her heart. ‘Where is thy form, 
and where are thy men,’ said she, ‘if thou art 
Ulixes ?’ ‘They are gone to ruin,’ said he.




---

p.28


‘What are the last tokens thou leftst with me?’ 
said she. ‘A golden brooch,’ said he, ‘and a 
head of silver was on it; and thy brooch I took 
with me when I went into the ship, and it was then 
thou didst turn away from us,’ said Ulixes.
‘That is true,’ said she, ‘and if thou art Ulixes,
I wil ask thy dog.’ ‘I did not expect her to be 
alive,’ said he. ‘I made her the gruel of long life, 
for I had seen the great love that thou didst bear 
her. And what sort of a dog now is she?’ said 
she. ‘Two shining white sides has she, and a 
light purple back and a jet-black belly, and a 
greenish tail,’ said Ulixes. ‘That is the description of the dog,’ said she; ‘and, moreover, no man 
in the place dared to give her food but myself and 
thee and the steward.’ ‘Let the dog be brought 
in,’ said Ulixes. And four men got up for her, and 
brought the dog into the house. And when she 
heard the sound of Ulixes' voice, she gave a pull 
at the chain, so that she sent the four men on 
their back through the house behind her, and she 
sprang the breast of Ulixes and licked his face and 
his countenance. When the people of Ulixes saw 
that, they sprang towards him. What man soever 
could not reach his skin, would kiss his garment 
with many kisses. And his wife did not go to 
him. ‘Thou art Ulixes,’ said she. ‘I am,’ said 
he. ‘Many are the Mighty Folk,’ said she, ‘and 
I shall keep my singleness until thy form come to



---

p.29




thee.’


He was a week there before she recognized 
his form; and then they became one. ‘I have 
a little box,’ said Ulixes, ‘which my good instructor gave me, and told me not to open it until
I should give it to thee.’ They opened it on the 
spot. Ninety ounces-viz., what he had given for 
the instruction-that was what was in it, and a cover 
of gold on the top of it, to preserve their true 
amount for him.


So this is the wandering of Ulixes the son of 
Laertes, from beginning to end, so far.
