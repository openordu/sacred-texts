74. In private possession. The Book of O'Conor Don, Clonalis, Co Roscommon, written at Ostend in 1631, by Aodh Ó Dochartaigh, as Prof. Hyde has shown in his description of the MS, Ériu 8, 78. The hand, though extremely neat and pleasing, is not a scholarly one, that is, it does not suggest that the writer had been educated in the tradition of the native schools. The text is often faulty, and in fact the principal value of this MS. is that it contains unique copies of a great many interesting pieces. The only poems of Tadhg Dall not found in it are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 18, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 41–44.

p.1


TO CONN O'DONNELL
-----------------


¶1] Raise the veil from Ireland; long hath she sought 
a spouse, finding no mate for her couch after the happiness 
of the men of *Fál* was blasted.


¶2] 
It is long since the Isle of Bregia could discover 
herself to any; a luckless widow is the wife of *Flann*—
land of splendid stone dwellings.


¶3] She could not but lose her beauty, it is thus with 
uncared for-women Ireland, land of sparkling, melodious 
streams, hath the complexion of loneliness.


¶4] Ushnagh's castle, darling of kings, hath been brought 
to such a state that it is a sorrowful omen to watch
over the fair, modest contours of her bright countenance.


¶5] Ireland's capitals have been defiled, one after 
another; a garment of weeds invests each keep, the white 
rampart of every castle is become a trench.


¶6] Her round hills have been stripped, her boundaries 
plowed over, so that *Té*'s Rampart, with its firm *(?)*
dwellings of white masonry, is not recognized by the 
guides.


¶7] Nought remains of them save their traces, they 
have exchanged comeliness for uncomeliness; the brightly-tapestried 
castles of Niall's *Banbha*—a cause of sorrow 
are they.


¶8] Howbeit, we think the more lightly of this mournful 
gloom which hangs over Ireland, since *Té*'s Rampart, 
which was named of Art, succour hath been foretold.




---

p.2


¶9] 
It is in store for it that a man shall come to dissolve 
its enchantments; needs must, then, that he shall one day 
take possession of the Field of the Gaels.


¶10] 
For thee, Conn, son of the Calvach, many a prophet 
hath truly foretold thee—it is fitting that you should seek 
one another—Ireland hath been waiting.


¶11] 
Alas, thou graceful of form, for him who does not 
give some thing of her desire to the smooth, yew-timbered, 
bright rampart, first couch of Conn and *Cobhthach*.


¶12] 
Look frequently on her bright countenance, bend 
thine eye upon her in secret; approach her graceful form, 
speak covertly with Ireland.


¶13] 
Embrace her, go to her couch, thou beautiful yet 
icy of flesh; take to thee the spouse of *Lugh*, lest Ireland 
be left unwedded.


¶14] 
Press the lips like berry-bloom, and the shining, 
snow-white teeth, in a kiss to Bregia of the smooth 
hill, amidst the welcome of the five provinces.


¶15] 
Great Niall, son of *Eachaidh*, from whom thou art 
sprung, O bright-cheeked countenance, bestowed just such 
a kiss, whereby he united (under his sway) the fair 
Dwelling of Eber.


¶16] 
Another such kiss gave Brian of *Bóroimhe*, by which 
he gained without dispute, thou white of hand, that stately 
dwelling place of the Sons of *Míl*.


¶17] 
As with other women in manifold enchantments, 
thou canst procure with a kiss the release of tearful 
*Banbha*, O white-footed, black-lashed youth.


¶18] 
As with women under enchantments, Ireland,
land of rippling waterfalls, plain of great fins, of 
shallow streams, will be the possession of him who 
rescues her.




---

p.3


¶19] 
Long ere her time there was a woman even as 
this country of the Sons of *Míl*, in ancient Africa, sandy, 
bright, of fertile hills, many-rivered, salmonful.


¶20] 
The man of yore who loved the princess of the 
wondrous isles changed the white-handed maiden of the 
soft, shining hair into a great, forbidding she-dragon.


¶21] 
The daughter of Hippocrates, son of *Núl*, spent 
a while in dragon's shape, under many and manifold 
enchantments, from which it had been difficult to rescue her.


¶22] 
Be the reason what it may, for one day in each 
year, in order, to rekindle her sorrow, the gift of beauty was 
granted to her sparkling, youthful countenance.


¶23] 
A merchant's son from the land of the west went 
to her once upon a time, and found the bright, 
sweetly-speaking, womanly beauty in her modest maiden's form.


¶24] 
He set the desire of his heart upon the woman, 
and prayed that the lovely, shining-haired one might be 
a mate for his own bright figure, though to seek her 
was a cause of remorse.


¶25] 
The bright-eyed queen replied, 'I would be thine 
were it possible, thou wondrous, comely youth, long-handed, 
gentle, dark-browed.'


¶26] 
'By consent or force thou shalt be mine,' said the 
brown-lashed youth. 'I have forsaken the glances of 
man, it cannot be,' returned the maiden.


¶27] 
'At all other times I am in the shape of a fiery 
dragon, so that my face *(though now)* smooth, modestly 
blushing, beloved, is horrifying to behold.'


¶28] 
'Is help in store for thee in days, to come?' said 
the youth, 'thou bright form, with clear countenance, 
when dost thou expect thy deliverance?'


¶29] 
'It is destined for me that a knight from the 
warriors of *Féilim*'s Land shall come when I am in 
dragon's shape, with a kiss whereby I shall be delivered.'




---

p.4


¶30] 
'The compassionate warrior shall be a husband 
to me, it is destined for him that he shall be made king 
over the islands, a thing difficult to accomplish.'


¶31] 
'It is destined for me', said the youth, 'I am from 
Ireland, to bestow that kiss which shall quench thy rage, 
thou curly-haired maiden, so young and noble.


¶32] 
'How could the thing thou sayest be destined for 
thee, my heart's fruit?' said the stately maiden, 'since 
thou hast never been a knight.'


¶33] 
On hearing that, the merchant's son took orders 
of chivalry; he departed from the rosy maiden of the 
soft, shining hair to learn a strange calling.


¶34] 
At the break of day he came again to visit the 
maiden; astonishing was the state in which he found the 
gracious beauty of the fair, soft tresses.


¶35] 
He found in the early morn the graceful figure 
with smooth brows, and the smooth, silky, heavy, luxuriant 
tresses, transformed into an awesome, fiery dragon.


¶36] 
On beholding the terrifying monster he fled in 
panic; that expedition ended in his death; a case not easy 
to succour.


¶37] 
The daughter of Hippocrates then returned to her 
chamber, and the heart of the white-footed, sweet-voiced 
maiden was full of sorrow.


¶38] 
She vowed that from that day on she would arise 
for no man until the coming of the prophesied one who 
was destined to release her from her bonds.


¶39] 
And even yet—long is the suffering—her gray 
modest-lashed eye, her pleasing form, her rosy countenance 
await her deliverer.


¶40] 
Ireland is that woman, O silky of hair, thou art 
the woman who shall deliver Ireland; and the hideous visage 
of the dragon is the tormenting host of ruthless foreigners.




---

p.5


¶41] 
Draw near to her, thou curly-headed one, do not 
shrink from the dragonlike aspect which clothes the 
sweet, beguiling streams of the Boyne; deliver Ireland 
from her disfigurement.


¶42] 
Many say of thee, Conn, descendant of Conn the 
Hundredfighter, thou heedest not that *Cobhthach*'s Plain 
has been for some time in the custody of foreigners.


¶43] 
They are right, O bright countenance, not very 
thankful are the Sons of *Míl* to thee, Conn, son of 
the Calvach, as regards the famed land of bright apple-trees.


¶44] 
Even though thou mayst not be supreme in the 
Land of the Gaels, thou thick-haired one, it is in thy 
power, Conn, to free the country of *Banbha* from its fetters.


¶45] It is easy for thee to win triumphs, the Sons of 
*Míl* are eager for war; it needs few forays, thou man 
of the Inny, to stir up *Banbha*.


¶46] 
A house takes fire from the one beside it; if thy 
intention of battle be heard, from thy head of wavy 
tresses the rest will take it; it is a ready desire that is 
ignited.


¶47] 
Even as the spreading of a flame, throughout this 
Plain of *Cobhthach* every territory will have its own 
reaver, from thy raids upon the foreign soldiery.


¶48] 
And the result, O wondrous form, shall be that 
the people of every territory, together with thee, O face 
ruddy as the berry, from which the stream is calm, shall 
storm the dividing boundaries of Gael and foreigner.


¶49] 
Take command of them, Conn, and lead them to 
Frewen; thou bright-handed warrior of Bregia, revivify 
the soldiery of the Gael.


¶50] 
Forsake not for Donegal, or the bay of *Eas Dá 
Éagann*, or ancient Loch Foyle, of the sparkling wines, 
the royal rampart of Tara in the east.




---

p.6


¶51] 
Alas, if anyone found that for the cocket of Sligo 
Bay, or for bright Croghan of the fair equipment thou 
wouldst abandon ancient Tara of *Tuathal Teachtmhar*.


¶52] 
The words of soothsayers, the utterances of saints, 
mate her with thee, O wavy tresses; did they not prophesy 
of yore the salmon from Frewen's fair harbor?


¶53] 
Prophets of thy rule, thou lord of *Bearnas*, are the 
promise of fruit on the green-leafed bough, the fury of 
the stream bearing its produce, the wave concealed 
beneath the washed-up treasure.


¶54] Abundance of milk from a small number of cattle, 
abundance of corn stacks before summer, and—soothsayers 
through whom thou art most clearly recognized—the ruined 
buildings of the churches repaired.


¶55] 
Thou at the service of all, and all submitting to 
thee; thou above everyone, and everyone above thee; 
thou at the pleasure of every man, and for all that, the 
Gaels at thy mercy.


¶56] 
The noble Gaels welcome thee to this enterprise, 
O cheerful heart; as a woman with her unlawful mate, 
so is Ireland with thy warriors.

TO HUGH O'DONNELL
-----------------


¶1] 
Welcome, thou son of Manus, from blue-harbored 
Tirconell; hasten, bright face, to Croghan's long-speared 
host.


¶2] 
Hasten to us, if thou art coming; to the north a 
visit is enough; make thy dwelling in Connacht, thou 
lord of the Ultonian plain.


¶3] 
Hasten thee, gentle *(?)* countenance, to view the 
province of *Ól nÉagmocht*; be not laggard of foot, come 
hither, admit no hindrance about it.


¶4] 
Welcome to thee, come hither, and gather thy noble 
assembly; make a full hosting, and advance through the 
fresh, bright-surfaced plain of Connacht.


¶5] 
Assemble the warriors of Ulster, it is long since 
they have been assembled, to check the contest of 
the tribes of Conn with thy thick, soft, gold-brown locks.


¶6] 
Ask of the seed of *Suibhne*, thou chief of Mourne, 
if they are grieved that the Connachtmen are contending 
with the powerful striplings of Ulster's land.


¶7] 
Say to the clans of noble Niall that they should 
make a union and alliance; display to them their great 
ties with us, thou golden king amongst chessmen.


¶8] 
Bring to us one after another the seed of *Eóghan*, 
the race of Conall, around thy bright, modestly-flushing 
face, to seek the tributes of the province.




---

p.8


¶9] 
Gather around thy brightly fringed locks thy 
battle-allies, thy marriage connections, and the host from 
*Liathdruim*'s walled castle—Colla's mighty kindred, so 
smooth of skin.


¶10] 
Though we speak thus, we know that on the day 
of the hosting thou needest only the descendants of noble 
*Dálach* of Bregia, the many-gifted ones of the 
five provinces.


¶11] 
Those four sections yonder of the race that sprang 
from Conall—all the armies of Tara would not be capable 
of fighting against them.


¶12] 
*Dálach*'s race, they of the smooth-walled fortresses, 
the race of *Dochartach*, the host of *Baoigheall*'s seed, and 
*Gallchobhar*'s bright, haughty stock, from whom the 
Ulstermen are without rest.


¶13] 
Those are the four battalions that follow the high-prince, 
disturbers of Conn's *Banbha*, valiant raiders of 
Conall's race.


¶14] 
Should the men of Ireland fail thee, the proven 
warriors of the four battalions, the champions of Tara's 
hill, will gain for thee the headship of Connacht.


¶15] Bring with thee the four-hosted seed of Conall in 
their full strength, that the plain of Croghan, delightful 
country, of fertile nooks, may be brought under rule.


¶16] 
Until thou avenge all that thou hast undergone, 
make neither peace nor settlement about the rich territory 
of *Sreang*'s ancient line, thine inherited portion of 
Ireland.


¶17] 
Be not satisfied until thou art here, we know, O 
bright bosom, that when the race of Conall shall have 
arisen, it is not yonder they will make peace with us.


¶18] Thou needst not fear to entrust thyself to them, 
until the assemblies of that race of Conall be simultaneously 
laid low thou art not likely to be overthrown in 
despite of them.




---

p.9


¶19] 
It were unfitting for thee to seek other aid, it befits 
that race of Conall, O shapely of form and white of 
hand, to do their utmost for thee.


¶20] 
Few among them, O modest eye, but are either 
beloved, worthy fosterers, or goodly fostersons, or sometime 
fosterbrothers to thee, thou fair-cheeked one.


¶21] 
Those who are older than thou are as thy fosterers, 
while the offspring of the rest are thy goodly fosterchildren, 
thou prophesied one of the Plain of Cormac.


¶22] 
Just such words as these Conall of *Cruacha* uttered 
long ago on *Magh Léana*, thou star of Sligo's host.


¶23] 
It was a day when battle was declared against 
Conn on *Magh Léana*, at the instigation of foreigners, 
by fearless *Mugh Nuadhad*, head with a sheltering mane 
of sleekly waving locks.


¶24] 
Around famed *Mugh Nuadhad,* with one accord, 
gather the pick of the men of Ireland, save only—princely, 
unconquered troop—the valiant *(?)* men of Connacht.


¶25] 
Conn had with him but the men of Connacht, for 
his protection in battle against the forces of all the rest 
of Ireland, warriors with sleek, shapely steeds.


¶26] 
'Too few for us are the Connachtmen,' said Conn, 
in converse with Conall, 'seeing that all Ireland is opposing 
us, thou soft, smooth and gentle of countenance.'


¶27] 
'The men of Ireland, from sea to sea,' such were 
the words of Conall, "should not make thee to quail 
whilst thou art amongst the hosts of the plain of 
Connacht.'


¶28] 
'Fosterer, fosterchild, or fosterbrother to thee,' 
said Conall, 'is everyone in the plain of Croghan, O 
yellow of hair, O beloved of women.'


¶29] 
'The elders of Connacht, one and all,' continued 
Conall, 'are-fosterers to thee, thou gentle, fair, black-lashed 
youth.'




---

p.10


¶30] 
'Those of thine own age, o stately eye, are thy 
foster brethren,' said Conall, 'since thou wast reared, 
thou bright of cheek, along with the people of Telton's 
smooth hills.'


¶31] 
'To end,' said Conall of *Cruacha*, our diffident*(?)* 
youths are all fostersons to thee, thou horseman of the 
Plain of the Champion.'


¶32] 
'Why, therefore, shouldst thou think thy number 
too small?' continued the high-king's fosterer, 'a, host 
of united friends are here, we shall not stir one foot in 
thy despite.'


¶33] 
The battle of the morn is won by Conn, sleek of 
hair, over *Mugh Nuadhad*d; well did Conall fulfil his good 
pledge to Conn.


¶34] 
And thus it is with thee, O'Donnell, thou shalt 
feel no inferiority in combat, while amongst Conall's 
warlike stock, o slender, powerful stately-eyed one.


¶35] 
O lion of the Erne, there is but one province 
opposing thee, whilst all Ireland, save Conall, was 
unitedly attacking Conn.


¶36] 
There are many trusty officers as good as Conall 
around thy dark-lashed cheek; *(they are to thee)* even 
as in his day Conn's Conall was to his king.


¶37] 
Even as Conn set his trust in the troops of Croghan, 
and in Conall, set thou thy trust in thy foster-brethren, 
and in the goodly youth of *Murbhach*.


¶38] 
Better these about the warrior of the Plain of the 
Fair than seven times their number of a summoned and 
pressed army from the other territories of Ireland.


¶39] 
As long as that fierce, watchful host survive, thou 
wilt fear little vexation, o crimson-bladed champion of 
*Oileach*.


¶40] 
What is it that hinders thee from coming to confront 
the men of Connacht, continually despoiling the 
men of Ireland-warriors with lithe, docile steeds?




---

p.11


¶41] 
And yet, I understand the reason of thy delay, 
thou ruler of fair *Fainn*'s plain; it is because the 
firmly-dyked plain of Connacht has no means to withstand thee.


¶42] 
It oppresses thy mind, Hugh, that Maeve's land, 
with fair, noble ramparts, should be spoiled by its own 
folk, although you are at variance.


¶43] 
Thou wouldst rather it were lost to thee wholly, 
O bright countenance, than that it should be destroyed 
between you; I think the babe is thine, O sleek-browed, 
supple-handed youth.


¶44] 
Hast thou heard of the women's dispute, or of the 
royal judgment which Solomon pronounced; thou stately 
scion from the rippling Moy, about the halving of the babe?


¶45] 
One day there came before Solomon two strange 
women, a comely, youthful-looking, bright pair, carrying 
between them a single infant.


¶46] 
Each of the women had come directly to him 
to certify that the babe was hers, in order that he might 
confirm that.


¶47] 
'Since you have no witness in this matter regarding 
the babe, I would fain divide it between you,' said the 
sage of the world.


¶48] 
'It is a good decision,' said one of the women, 
'that great Solomon, son of David, has given us concerning 
the rosy, supple-armed offspring: that the child should
be divided between us.'


¶49] 
'I had rather my own babe were out of harm's 
way even shouldst thou have it altogether,' replied the 
other woman.


¶50] 
'Thou art the mother of the boy,' said the judge 
famed for his awards; 'assuredly he has been in thy 
womb, thou dost not allow the child to be divided.'


¶51] 
Even thus, Hugh, son of Manus—where am I 
telling it of thee?—thou hast not ravaged the plain of 
Connacht on account of wrong or transgression.




---

p.12


¶52] 
Since it is thine, thou smooth and soft of skin, 
thou wouldst not ravage Connacht, o blameless hand;
the babe was begot by thee.


¶53] 
Thou hast spared Conn's Croghan, thou hast protected 
the haven of ancient, clear-streamed Sligo against 
Conall's line, in spite of the impatient men of Ulster.


¶54] 
Didst thou follow the counsel of the rest, Telton 
would be in a blaze, and Croghan dismantled; listen not 
to their entreaties.


¶55] 
Even wert thou thyself attacking them, on account 
of the Ineen Duv, thou torrential stream from the Bregian 
Boyne, it would not be possible to devastate them.


¶56] 
In any province where that woman is, none dare 
to talk of strife; the Land of *Fionntan* has shown *(?)* 
that she has curbed the race of Conall.


¶57] 
Until the daughter of James came to us, and until 
the land of Bregia became subdued to her will, we would 
not keep peace with the rest for the twinkling of an eye.


¶58] 
From the time that she came across the sea the 
race of *Dálach*, on account of the queen of *Cobha*'s pure 
plain, do not remember in their hearts the offences of 
others.

p.13


TO HUGH O'DONNELL
-----------------


¶1] The race of Conall will praise the children of *Tál*, 
may hap that these plunderings of Conall's Plain be a 
token of fortune for the seed of noble *Ros* from the 
gently-flowing Maigue.


¶2] 
For sometime past the seed of Brian and that race 
of Conall have been coupled together; receiving praise 
and satire.


¶3] 
We poets of the North used to compose eulogies 
for the seed of red-speared Conall in provocation of the 
tribe of *Cas*, stems from the fair banks of the Fergus.


¶4] We poets of the seed of Hundred-battling Conn, 
have, whatever the reason, harmed the repute of the great 
and ancient race of *Mugh *Nuadhad**, valor's inherited 
capital.


¶5] 
We used not to compose a long poem of praise, 
or even one humorous stanza, without corresponding 
dispraise of the race of *Corc*, stems most strange to attack.


¶6] Fearing that we may have to approach them, we 
are remorseful for what we used to do against the beloved 
seed of *Cas,* so famed in battle.


¶7] 
It was not for the sake of cattle or golden goblets, 
precious jewels or mantles of red satin, that we found 
reasons for satirizing the fair warriors of Fermoyle.


¶8] 
But that a short time ago—sorrowful indeed—a fine 
poet from the northern half went yonder to the west to 
study his art in Munster.




---

p.14


¶9] 
And it befell—most harmfully—that the foreign 
rulers of *Mac Con*'s Munster arrested the poet of Ulster 
when he was perfected in his art.


¶10] The poet of O'Donnell of Donegal, by the dreadful 
rule of foreigners—to be brief, he was slain in the south, 
which caused the simultaneous ruin of the poets.


¶11] It was foreign tyranny that caused them to suffer 
his murder; the race of *Sadhbh* should not bear the 
blame, though it befell them to commit it.


¶12] However, from arrogance of mind I plied the 
edge of my just wrath on the tribe of *Cas*, mischievously 
and pridefully.


¶13] 
I, like every other man, acted as I should not have 
done towards the kindly, generous children of *Tál*, a 
proceeding which enhanced my unfairness.


¶14] 
It fell out, thereafter, that war arose between the 
Ulstermen and the hosts of firmly-walled Croghan; a 
cause of deep flushing in bright faces.


¶15] 
It was proclaimed by the race of *Dálach* that not 
even friends or comrades should be protected throughout 
the land of *Oilill*, dry, bright-stoned plain, watered by 
melodious streams.


¶16] Thereupon my kinsfolk, my own friends, oblige 
me to go and seek protection and surety from the stern, 
powerful kindred of *Dálach*.


¶17] Despite all they had lavished upon me, this I have 
to say of the tribe of Conall, they had no mind to 
undertake my protection; unhappy the condition of the friends.


¶18] 
I do not deny that it is the same to me as if the 
seed of Conall were plundering me, for the mighty 
champions of *Beanna Boirche* to refuse me in the matter 
of protection.




---

p.15


¶19] Having heard what they recited to me on thy 
behalf, Hugh O'Donnell, I am filled with wrath and 
impatience towards thy ruddy, bronzed, bright-cheeked 
countenance.


¶20] 
For thy public proscription of me, thou king of 
noble Conall's line, the powerfully attended host of 
*Murbhach* have no sufficing compensation to offer.


¶21] 
The hearts of king's children will bound, if I go 
from thee in enmity; fair faces will flame amongst 
*Almhu*'s, keen-bladed host.


¶22] 
Though I am at war with the race of *Dálach* 
about my cattle, there went not from me into Ulster 
unjustly even the value of a single cow.


¶23] Nevertheless, I shall depose against the battalions 
of the haven of *Duibhlinn* that they plundered me 
of all that is in my home, O supple-bodied lord of Calry.


¶24] 
I shall say, O son of Manus, that thou hast 
wrought me harm, and requital for the harm thou hast 
not done me will be given, O lord of *Bearnas*.


¶25] 
It was in this fashion, O thick-haired one, that 
*Maol Miolsgothach* obtained of yore from the race of 
famous Niall that extraordinary award of goods.


¶26] 
One of the nobles of Niall's seed, thus the matter 
arose, met his death by *Mac Coise*; thereat they became 
incensed.


¶27] 
Upon the kindling of their resentment the road-skilled*(?)*
warriors of Niall's line threaten to go and 
plunder the poet in return for the unseemly, woeful deed.


¶28] 
*Mac Coise* upon hearing this, went to the high-king 
of *Oileach*—generous hero for whom the sea was 
calm, helm of sovranty to Ulster.


¶29] 
Donnell grandson of Niall, then asked the poet 
for a story; the best of story-tellers was he, narrator of 
all Ireland's lore.




---

p.16


¶30] *Mac Coise* enquired if he had heard a number of 
entertaining stories; he named them, one after another, 
to the graceful, white-handed hero of *Bóroimhe*.


¶31] From the time that *Ceasair* took possession of the 
plain of Bregia, all the curious stories of the Field of 
the Gael were known by heart, he found, to the gallant 
hero of *Maonmhagh*.


¶32] About the destruction of his own house, then, 
the poet composed an original fable for his splendid, 
angelic countenance.


¶33] *Iorard* said, in short, that some of Donnell's kinsmen 
had destroyed his dwelling, homestead of bright, glittering 
stones.


¶34] *Oileach*'s king, with braided locks, Donnell, son of 
*Muircheartach*, gave to the elfin, comely countenance 
requital for the damage he had not wrought.


¶35] The breadth of his face of pure gold he gave to 
the poet as an honor-price; and that is but a small part 
of the various payments he got from the powerful chief 
of *Gáirighe*.


¶36] In return for the falsehood he had composed about 
the kindred of Niall, the slender-handed youths of Bregia 
thereupon dispensed gifts more than he could reckon to 
the poet.


¶37] The choicest of their rings, of their goblets 
encrusted with precious stones, did *Mac Coise, Maol 
Miolsgothach*—well did his bluster succeed—get in 
payment for the hurt they had not wrought.


¶38] *Mac Coise*'s claim against the kindreds of Niall, as I 
know, O cheery of face, is a sufficing pattern for a claim 
upon thee, thou lord of the fair Plain of *Conchobhar*.


¶39] The precious treasures, the gift of cattle, that 
*Mac Coise* got from *Eóghan*'s kin—why should not such 
be dispensed to me, thou scion from the timbered House 
of Croghan?




---

p.17


¶40] 
It did not become me, thou lord of *Line*, either 
from affection or from fear of reproach, to be forbearing 
in the matter, thou wise and righteous of mien *[sic]*.


¶41] 
In short, thou man of honorable intention—it is I 
myself that am patient; a buffet from a red fist in thy 
bright cheek is the sentence thou deservest from me.


¶42] 
Thou hast bidden me, thou smooth of hair, to 
guard my cattle from thee—my state is nothing but 
banishment, thou noble king of Frewen.


¶43] 
For the love of thine honor, tell me wouldst thou 
establish thyself there in my place, if I left my native 
territory?


¶44] 
To whom in the world wilt thou guarantee surety 
or respect, thou protecting shield of Ulster's shore, 
after thou hast banished me?


¶45] 
Hardly should I ever find again, after thy decree, 
thou slender scion from the Bregian Boyne, one friend 
with whom it were fitting to live.


¶46] 
O supple form, as it is with thee I was reared, thou 
son of Manus, this increases my depression—that the knee 
which nursed me should reject me.


¶47] 
Amongst them I was brought up, until I had spent 
the greater part of my life; great was the comradeship 
with me of every lord of Conall's curly-haired race.


¶48] 
Whenever the descendants of *Tál*, or the graceful, 
vigorous kindred of Niall were mentioned in my presence, 
thou prince of *Iomghán*, I used not to make *(great)* people 
of them.


¶49] 
I shall belie myself if I am for any time at odds 
with thy noble, crimson, melodious countenance; *(my)* 
praises of thee will be refuted by my censure.


¶50] 
I shall compose a refreshing piece of censure for 
thee after my lamentation; it shall be as a eulogy of 
the blood of *Tál*, thou dark-lashed chief of *Iomghán*.




---

p.18


¶51] 
It is a piece of fortune for the seed of Brian that 
I shall become resentful towards the nobles of Conall's 
line, offspring of a goodly seed from the City of Conn.


¶52] 
Wert thou remorseful for the hurt thou hast not 
done me, I would accept and give an honor-price, O 
blushing cheek.


¶53] 
All the greater is the guilt of *Dálach*'s clan in 
opposing a comrade, since hitherto they have not been 
wont to plunder any man of letters.


¶54] 
From the side of either Core or Conn—there is no 
noble connection whom thou owest to resemble, O Hugh 
O'Donnell, that was not wont to show forbearance towards 
poets.

p.19


THE BATTLE OF DRUMLEENE
-----------------------


¶1] Drumleene is a precinct of vengeance; much evil 
and injustice hath been committed in contention for that 
hill, in the valley of conspicuous inlets.


¶2] Often have its slopes been turned into a crimson, 
blood-red mass, and every dip of its glowing fields filled 
with mangled bodies.


¶3] Many a time ere this has the lake in front of it been 
turned to blood, and its waves purpled with gore on the 
brink of the vengeful ridge.


¶4] The deathful slopes of Drumleene! Never have there 
been nor ever shall be such evil deeds in any other plain 
in Ireland as those of this fair fresh-verdured expanse.


¶5] Since the days of the Children of Nemed, the fresh, 
brightly-glistening surface of the smooth hill of *Cruachán 
Lighean* has been bathed in the blood of champions.


¶6] 
*Conning*, son of *Faobhar*, son of *Flath*, it was he 
who fought the first battle in contest for the land of 
Bregia, by the calm waters of Drumleene.


¶7] 
Nine hundred of the Children of Nemed, 
of their chieftains, of their soldiery, fell by *Conuing's* 
battalions on the brown surface of that field.


¶8] Then the five sons of mighty *Deala*, son of *Lóch*, 
gave battle on the hill to the noble warriors of *Fál*, 
by the ancient dyke of *Cruachán*, peak.


¶9] 
In the same spot, after a space, great *Breas*, son of 
*Ealatha*, gave battle to the warriors of *Lochlann* for the 
noble hill of graceful castles.




---

p.20


¶10] 
Of the fighting men of *Banbha* there fell by *Breas* 
upon the ancient, awesome slope one hundred and three 
worthy to reign, as well as mercenaries of the land.


¶11] 
Of three thousand *Fir Bolg* there escaped from the 
conflict—distress enough was the amount of the spoil—
but five.


¶12] 
When the mighty race of *Míl* of Spain returned 
to the land of *Fál*, *(such fury as)* the fury of these men 
upon the fair summit of the slopes of Drumleene is untold.


¶13] 
In days of conflict the three gallant sons of *Cearmaid* 
are slain by them, three valiant ones for whom hazels 
bore fruit-laden branches, pillars of fair *Cathair Chröoinn*.


¶14] 
They waged, then, three battles upon the perilous 
slopes of Drumleene, and they took to themselves the 
sovranty of Bregia, a step in the Gaelic conquest.


¶15] 
The Sons of *Míl*, moreover, and the flower of the 
*Tuath Dé Danann*, these also perished in the slaughter 
on the white-knolled green of *Cruachán*.


¶16] 
Never on any other hill of *Úghaine's* Land have 
there been slain half as many warriors as the number 
that fell on the glistening mounds of *Cruachán*.


¶17] 
Until the stars of heaven be numbered, or the great 
sands of the sea, it will not be possible to recount the 
evil deeds wrought on the brightly foliaged hill with its 
ancient fields.


¶18] 
Six royal battles ere now have been waged around 
the fair hill of Foyle, by the sluggish stream, without 
recording any petty fray.


¶19] 
In short, this is the seventh battle, this mighty 
conflict of to-morrow, that the champion of Ulster's land 
will wage upon this mound of which ye have heard.


¶20] 
It is he, moreover, who will give battle, Hugh, 
son of Manus, of Tara's rampart; the cheery and ruddy 
of countenance, that is most wont to triumph over the foe.




---

p.21


¶21] 
This great battle of the morrow is the grievous, 
destructive plague which has set the four elements trembling 
throughout the spacious Rampart of *Lughaidh*.


¶22] 
That is what has made flaming folds of the hills 
of the world, and sent the waves through the forest 
thickets in mighty masses of flame.


¶23] 
The spurting fires of heaven, a presage of conflict, 
have appeared, with the great maned star in a wondrous, 
warlike array.


¶24] 
The sepulchred dead will be struggling and contending, 
throughout *Fál*'s plain the corpses are quickening, 
in expectancy of the extraordinary evil.


¶25] 
Throughout the delightful expanses of the Field 
of the Fair the beasts of *Banbha*'s plain are uttering 
intelligent speech, simultaneously proclaiming the woes 
of Ireland.


¶26] 
Brutes are brought forth in human shape, and men 
in the form of brutes, many a monster has that created 
throughout the dyked meadow of *Cobhthach*.


¶27] 
The ravenous Fury of battle is inciting the great 
chief, passing over the isles of Ireland with crimson tresses 
about her head.


¶28] 
Until morn come, the phantom women of faery, 
the wolves and wild animals, will utter presage of the 
coming battle to the host of *Macha*.


¶29] 
Many this night, throughout both armies, will be 
the spectres, ghosts and apparitions around the spoiler of 
*Banbha*'s castles.


¶30] 
Many a soldier in the camp of the warrior of Bregia 
will have had his shield on his wrist since the night 
before; many the long fingers looped around javelins, 
hands clasped about swordhilts.


¶31] 
In the morn betimes there will be many a meal 
consumed without comfort, warriors whetting *(?)* their 
keen weapons, shrieks of scaldcrows and ravens.




---

p.22


¶32] 
Most horrifying, then, will be the clang of the 
clashing spears, the whistle of their sharp blades with 
dripping points, the harsh calling of their ivory horns.


¶33] 
Piteous, at the same time, will be the bellowing of 
the gaping brutes, the voices of the wolves from the 
heights of *Banbha*, the fluttering of strange banners.


¶34] 
Betimes to-morrow morn the blue assembly mound 
of *Cruachán*, the woeful ridgepole of all slaughter, 
will be a clamorous hillock.


¶35] 
The battle of to-morrow morning will be gained, 
as is wont, by the keen-eyed host from *Teach Truim* and 
the stately race of Conall.


¶36] 
Does Hugh pay heed to the complaint of the 
creatures in human form, the moaning of the streams, 
the clouds in the heavens, the tidings of the soothsayers?


¶37] 
Or is it the complaint of Conall's kindred, that the 
army of the chieftain of *Fál* is kept parleying about 
battle, that afflicts his brown cheek?


¶38] 
Long have they been attending him, without returning 
to their native lands, the long-handed scion of Bregia is 
wearying the Children of *Míl*.


¶39] 
Long does it seem to the man from the Moy, and 
from the cool brink of *Sríbh Broin*, from the Curlews 
and from the lands of Oriel in Ulster, not to return home.


¶40] 
Whether it prove his undoing or his advantage, 
whether the victory be for or against Hugh, since it 
awaits him it is high time to face it.


¶41] 
Readily can he go into battle before the mighty 
host of the warriors of Tara, few therein that are not 
forest-trees of the true family of the race of Conall, 
towering above the wood.


¶42] 
Gathered about his soft locks are the heroes of the 
*Tuatha*, the warriors of Fanad, the kingly youth of Inishowen, 
delightful hosts from whom the sea is easy to fish.

p.23


¶43] 
From the other side he will be joined by the 
danger-braving hawks of *Beanna-Boghaine* and a fierce 
host from the glens of *Bearnas*, a red-speared, blue-bladed 
herd.


¶44] 
With him moreover, one after another, are his own 
kinsmen of the race of Conall, who have no mind to 
retreat one step, champions from the castle of *Durlas*.


¶45] 
Better these around the warrior of the Plain of 
the Fair than seven times their number of a summoned 
and pressed army from the other territories of Ireland.

LIFFORD CASTLE
--------------


¶1] 
A beloved dwelling is the castle of Lifford, homestead 
of a wealth-abounding encampment; forge of hospitality 
for the men of Ulster, a dwelling it is hard to leave.


¶2] 
Beloved are the two who keep that house without 
excess, without lack; the ward of the stout, even-surfaced 
tower are the supporting pillars of the province.


¶3] 
Short is the day, no matter what its length, in the 
company of the royal warrior of *Conchobhar*'s Plain; fleet 
are the long days from the lady of bright-walled Tara.


¶4] 
The daughter of noble Shane O'Neill, and the son 
of O'Donnell of *Dún Iomgháin*—they are in the ancient, 
comely dwelling as entertainers of guests.


¶5] Dear the hostel in which these are wont to be, 
dear the folk -who dwell in the hostel; the people of the 
house and the house of that people—happy is any who 
shall get honor such as theirs.


¶6] 
Beloved the delightful, lofty building, its tables, 
its coverlets, its cupboards; its wondrous, handsome, firm 
walls, its smooth marble arches.


¶7] Beloved is the castle in which we used to spend 
a while at chess-playing, a while with the daughters of 
the men of Bregia, a while with the fair books of the 
poets.


¶8] 
The fortress of smooth-lawned Lifford—no one in 
the world can leave it once it is found; that dwelling is 
the *Durlas* of the north.




---

p.25


¶9] Or else it is *Eamhain* which used to vary in form, 
or Croghan of the children of *Mágha*, or Tara of the race 
of *Cobhthach*—this bright castle, rich in trees and horses.


¶10] Or it is Naas, the fortress of Leinster, as it was 
first fashioned; or the fertile, ancient abode of the children 
of *Corc*, green, conspicuous Cashel.


¶11] Or it is fair Lifford itself—hardly is any of these 
castles better—which hath of yore assumed those shapes 
ye are wont to hold dear.




---

p.26


LIOS GRÉINE
-----------


¶1] 
*Lios Gréine* is the *Eamhain* of Ulster; a dwelling 
not to be deserted for *Tailte*; a house whose gifts are 
not excelled, booty taken from the foreigner is bestowed 
in that bright dwelling.


¶2] 
It is the fairy castle of *Ealcmhar* in loveliness, a 
dwelling which of yore was held by kings; enough is it 
to set all at variance, a sunny castle like to the *Brugh*
of the Boyne.


¶3] 
It is akin to *Guaire*'s *Durlas*, it was built by the 
descendant of the earls; dwelling of feasting, wine-wealthy 
hosts, royal castle abounding in spears and bridles.


¶4] 
*Lios Gréine*, saffron-tinted castle of brave melody, 
the sight of it will relieve sickness; plenty therein of all 
kinds of delight, fair stead amidst green-topped hazel-trees.


¶5] 
White-lathed, straightly built castle, a habitation 
beguiling to companies; *Dún Dealgan*—bright fortress 
similar to the rampart—is such another as this lofty castle.


¶6] 
Fort full of booty, of companies, of drinking horns, 
long shall this dwelling be remembered; much hath the 
shapely fort laid desolate; a mirthful rampart like to 
*Lios Luigheach*.


¶7] 
A fort like that of famed Ushnagh, which the 
Hound of the Feats subdued *(?)*; bring no woman within 
this tower, similar to Troy is the dwelling.


¶8] 
The level green lawn about the sunny castle is 
like plowed land, from the prancing of vigorous steeds: 
no one hath tilled the bright sod, but its state is caused 
by the exercising of young and spirited horses.




---

p.27


¶9] 
Horses on the lawn around the bright castle, 
shining spears being polished; the race of Conn 
driving round, well-set nails in preparation for exercising their 
steeds.


¶10] 
From the prince who is lord of this house *Banbha*
shall know no lack; he is a man whose fame is such as 
that Hound's—similar to him was the Hound of the Feats.


¶11] 
Shane leads us to *Rath Éanna*[*...*] hostage for the 
prowess of *Úna*'s Land, spouse of Conn [*...*] [1](javascript:footNote('T402563/note001.html')).


¶12] 
The darling of Tara hath won great triumph, Shane 
is proven in combats [*...*] [2](javascript:footNote('T402563/note002.html'))it is right to shun the wrath 
of a warrior.


¶13] A keen steed beneath thee, swift as a hawk [*gap: extent: three lines*][3](javascript:footNote('T402563/note003.html')).


¶14] 
Until thou canst win her will from Tara, thou son 
of Conn, unflinching in battle—goodly fame is not to be 
thought little of—thou provest thy worth in conflict.


¶15] 
*Lugh* Longhand, lord of Tara, who left no foe 
unsubdued—many a soothsayer says it of thee—is thy 
similitude over the Plain of *Connla*.


¶16] 
Stretch forth from bright Dungannon, suffer not 
the land of Niall to be unsubmissive to thee; it is meet 
to exalt one nut above the cluster, I choose thee for the 
qualities of *Cú Chulainn*.


¶17] 
Sufficing is the agility of thy slender tipped spears-
hafts, they will send the foreign hosts across the bright 
sea; it is no reproach to *Bearchán* to have announced 
thee—the ancient plain of Niall is well foretold for thee.


¶18] 
Not much of other men's wealth does he hoard, 
bright satin such as is not wont to be in a hostage-cell *(?)*; 
as he returns triumphant from a territory gentle, sharp 
and eager are the steeds around the sunny dwelling.

To Turlogh Luineach
-------------------


¶1] 
Many privileges have the seed of Niall, it is long 
since they, the seed of the forest-tree from the Bregian 
Boyne, were ordained above the rest of *Míl*'s mighty kin.


¶2] 
Even when they are not ruling the Land of the 
Fair, the high-king of Ireland is not entitled to any 
increase of homage from the goodly race of *Eóghan*, 
orchard-stems of *Cobhthach*'s kindred.


¶3] 
When any other king rules the Plain of *Úghaine*
no exchange of hostages is got from the goodly race of 
Nine-hostaged Niall.


¶4] 
But when one of the O'Neills is made king, then 
it is no matter of doubt that the keen-bladed race of 
noble Niall obtains pledges from every Irishman.


¶5] 
They, being the most excellent, have given hire 
to the men of Ireland, but the flower of Bregia's 
ever-roving host are not bound to accept hire.


¶6] 
O'Neill is entitled to the blood-price if any of his 
people be killed, but he gives no honor-price to any of 
the strongly fettering host of the Gael.


¶7] 
We know, moreover, that in no part of Ireland 
are their rights withheld, while these hosts so heroic in 
exploit hold the dues of all Ireland.


¶8] 
The descendants of Niall of the Nine Fetters, stems 
from the Hill of the Fair, there have not been, nor will 
there ever be any Irishmen such as they.




---

p.29


¶9] 
The kings of Ireland who were not of them, and the 
race of mighty Niall, son of *Eachaidh*—not more numerous 
in the regal list are kings from other stock than from them.


¶10] 
From them are the kings of hilly *Banbha*, from 
them the choicest of Ireland's noble saints; from the seed 
of royal Niall of the land of Bregia, the stainless, righteous 
ones of the Gael.


¶11] 
*Mac Coise* estimated the race of Niall, and in no 
respect did he find in them any traces of wickedness or 
transgression, any more than in the angels of the haven 
of paradise.


¶12] 
'Whosoever is the worst of Niall's stock, I testify,' 
said *Mac Coise*, 'that he excels all others besides them, 
that company from *Tuatha Teamhrach*.'


¶13] 
The best of Niall's stock, these, palmtrees from the 
haven of Derry, he did not speak of as men, but as angels 
in fleshly body.


¶14] 
The judgment of *Mac Coise* of *Cluain* on the seed 
of Niall of red-weaponed *Oileach* has ever since had wide 
and enduring repute throughout the host of *Fionntan*'s 
wine-abounding plain.


¶15] 
There are many other reasons whereby the 
descendants of *Eóghan* especially surpass in nobility the rest 
of Niall's saintly race, noble stems from a single root.


¶16] 
*Eóghan*, son of glorious Niall, branch above the 
forest of *Macha*'s plain, obtained, beyond the other children 
of the high-prince, the blessing of the primate Patrick.


¶17] 
Patrick of the Haven of the Fair bequeathed to 
*Eóghan*, rather than to the rest of Niall's seed, and to 
his vigorous and noble stock, the honor and prowess of 
Ireland.


¶18] 
They ruled the descendants of *Criomhthan*, and 
never since, in virtue of the patron's legacy, has any one 
of the men of Ireland obtained power over *Eóghan*'s, seed.




---

p.30


¶19] 
The seed of Niall is the outcome of the ancient 
blessings, the fruit of the holy man's prayer has now 
come to Turlogh, apple-branch of Tara's wood.


¶20] 
Son of Niall, son of Art *Óg*, son of Conn, descendant
of the kings from Frewen, most righteous king that man
ever saw of the mighty sons of *Míl*.


¶21] 
The difference between gold and copper, the difference 
between the moon and the stars, such is the 
difference whereby the lord of Bangor's fertile plain 
exceeds all other Irishmen.


¶22] 
A king who never allowed the men of Ireland to 
outdo the Ulstermen in anything, the king proven to be 
best, surpassing all Ireland.


¶23] 
A king through whom the men of Ulster are 
without war, without conflict; without envy, without 
resentment, without anger, without destruction of castles, 
without reaving.


¶24] 
A king who never broke his kingly word, the king 
to whom evildoers are most hateful: a king who will 
promise nothing under heaven save that which is certain 
to be done.


¶25] 
Even on the highway a ring of ruddy gold might be 
safely left for a year, such is the rigor of the law 
amongst the men of Ulster.


¶26] 
Under the glancing eye of the mighty hero of 
*Macha* the women of *Fál*'s Plain might *(each one)* traverse 
Ulster singly, clad in garments of varied hue, broidered 
with gold.


¶27] If a ship laden with treasure were cast unguarded 
by the coast, such power does Turlogh wield that it 
would depart without infraction.


¶28] All the more wonderful is it for the man to have 
brought the Fifth into such a state, seeing that, save 
Ulster alone the whole of bright and fertile *Banbha* is 
one wave of depredation.




---

p.31


¶29] 
That deluge whereby God desolated the world, or 
else just such another, has been sent upon Bregia's dewy 
rampart; the happiness of *Banbha* has been extinguished.


¶30] 
In the land of the children of *Rudhruighe* there 
is another conspicuous Noah, stately presence, whose 
excellence is acknowledged, shielding it from the 
down-pouring of the flood.


¶31] 
Now, out of all *Banbha*, Turlogh keeps the fifth 
part of Tara's land unwetted by Ireland's deluge of 
lawlessness.


¶32] 
Even thus of yore did the King of Heaven bring 
Noah son of Lamech, fruitful scion, of word inviolate, 
across the heaving sea of the Flood.


¶33] 
In the days of great Noah son of Lamech the world 
lay beneath the darkness of mist through lack of 
reverence for creative God; a well-known matter ever since.


¶34] 
Save Noah himself and his three sons, the seed of 
Adam then, all the people of the world, it is said, were 
abounding in wickedness and sin.


¶35] 
The angel of God comes down from heaven on a 
certain day to the son of Lamech, to prophesy to him 
before the Flood, that most destructive downpour.


¶36] 
'The fierce, dark streams of the flood,' said God's 
messenger to him, 'most able destroyers of them, will 
overwhelm all simultaneously.'


¶37] 'Let a firm, stout-flanked vessel be made by you,' 
said the angel, 'ere the black, scorching brine come across 
the solid plain of the earth.'


¶38] 
Upon the angel's entreaty the son of Lamech—
what courage—makes a graceful, smooth-masted ark, a 
glistening watertight ship.


¶39] When the ark had been made ready the King of 
the elements, God the Father, sent the Flood upon the 
earth and laid it waste.




---

p.32


¶40] 
Until God in requital of their crimes had overwhelmed 
the whole world, save eight alone, He ceased 
not to harry them in His righteous anger.


¶41] 
It was not the comely, graceful ark that saved 
them from the wrath of the Deluge whilst the tide was 
rising, but the prayers and the saintliness of Noah.


¶42] 
The foreigners are the deluge, the Plain of 
*Conchobhar* is the ark, and the Noah of that land is 
Turlogh, noble, hospitable scion of Tara's fold.


¶43] 
Even as formerly Noah was chosen by Him, today, 
according to His wisdom, God has chosen beyond 
any of the warriors of the bright plain of the Gaels the 
heavenly countenance of O'Neill.


¶44] 
Amongst the Gaels of Tara's Field God Himself 
has chosen Turlogh, it is not easy to alter that choice 
of the God of the elements.


¶45] 
It is not to be wondered at though a fierce, 
powerful king such as he perform any of his actions, 
considering the number of kings of Ireland that were 
of his stock.


¶46] 
Twenty-six kings, in the reckoning of rulers, reigned 
over the Gaels' land of dark yewtrees, from Niall son of 
*Eachaidh* down to Turlogh to whom the forest bends.


¶47] 
Sixteen kings of *Eóghan*'s race preceded him, no 
statement of an unlearned man, and ten kings, one after 
another, of the long-speared seed of Conall.


¶48] 
Seventy-two kings, reckoning up from Niall of the 
fair waving hair to proud *Míl* of Spain, ruled over the 
pleasant, cool and dewy Plain of *Fál*.


¶49] 
Eight kings and four score ruled before him over 
the field of the Gael; such is the resplendent pedigree 
of the high-king, the latest generation is the best.




---

p.33


¶50] 
And further, if, as is not the case, the rest were 
of equal estimation with the race of *Eóghan*, the homage 
of Bregian *Banbha* would of necessity be given to the 
hero of *Annla*.


¶51] 
It is no season for Irishmen to oppose the power 
of O'Neill; it is no disgrace not to withstand thee now, 
since thou wert not withstood as *(simple)* Turlogh.


¶52] 
O Turlogh, grandson of Art, little short of woeful
were it for any one who should see the homage of one 
Gael begrudged thee about *Flann*'s Field.

p.34


To Turlogh Luineach
-------------------


¶1] At Christmas we went to the Creeve; all the poets 
of *Fódla* were assembled together by the smooth wall of 
the hospitable castle wherein O'Neill lay at Christmastide.


¶2] 
One of O'Neill's dwelling-places was the pleasant, 
lightsome Creeve—never was there built a court to excel 
it—wherein all the delight of Ireland was comprised.


¶3] 
It was then that the unopposed kingship was 
sustained by a noble scion from Tara's height, Turlogh, 
the fruitful branch.


¶4] 
It was ten years since the king had been inaugurated, 
and the gallant, famous branch of *Almhu* had built a 
dwelling in the Creeve.


¶5] We proceed to the Creeve to seek the white-toothed, 
bright-faced chieftain, we, the encomium-makers of the 
Land of the Fair, the poets of Ireland.


¶6] 
It seemed to us, when entering, as if the wall of 
the firmament had fallen, from the tumult of the sleek, 
yellow-bridled steeds around the lord of *Raoiliu*'s pathed 
plain.


¶7] 
And afterwards it seemed to us, from the sheen of 
weapons and accoutrements, that the whole place was 
aflame from roof to foundation.


¶8] 
The sounds of banqueting in the court of the 
descendant of Nine-fettered Niall we liken to a stormy sea 
coming against the shore, from the clashing of purple vessels.




---

p.35


¶9] 
When just in sight of the rampart even were I at 
the shoulder of any man I could not hear him because 
of the strains of music from the citadel.


¶10] 
Ere we had arrived beside it, it seemed to me that 
the brilliance of its bright-surfaced goblets, and the fragrant 
odour of its banquet ales were of themselves a sufficient 
enjoyment.


¶11] 
We seat ourselves, ordered and compact hosts, on 
the border of the lawn; in front of that noble dwelling 
amidst rich sward was a poet from every quarter of Ireland.


¶12] After a space there come to us the officers of Conn of 
the Hundred-fighter's descendant, and they welcomed 
each one, with salutations to all from the high-king.


¶13] 
No glimpse of the high-king of Ushnagh was had 
by us that night; the slender, soft-haired hero of Bregia 
dismissed us to our sleeping chamber.


¶14] 
From then till morn the fair, haughty cupbearers
of famed O'Neill plied us unrelaxingly with refreshment.


¶15] 
He sent a man to inquire of us if any of our poems 
contained tidings of his battles throughout Ireland, accounts 
of his triumphs and exploits.


¶16] 
'No,' said the poets of Ireland, 'but,' continued 
the men of art, 'we have, without any degree of 
uncertainty, the origin of the genealogical ramifications of 
Conn's descendants.'


¶17] 
'We have,' said the poets of Ireland then, 'The 
privileges of Niall's seed', the number of their race that 
ruled over the Bregian Boyne, and all that was rightful 
for them to do.'


¶18] 
'We have said that the Rampart of Croghan, 
country of shallow rills, and the Rampart of *Té*, humid 
and pleasing territory, are his by right, and that he is 
the sole heir to Ireland.'




---

p.36


¶19] 
The messenger went to seek the bright-faced, 
boldly-glancing chieftain, and on the morrow he related 
the speeches to O'Neill of Mourne.


¶20] 
'If their matter for encomium be what they have 
said,' quoth the son of Niall, 'rather is it their reproach; 
it is simply an exhortation of the race of *Eóghan*!'


¶21] 
'It were a great insult to the youths of Tara,' said 
Turlogh, if Tara's plain should be wrested from Art's 
generous line and they should be unable to avenge it.'


¶22] 
O'Neill of Tara of Trim declared that he would 
not listen to any of our poems, but—strange to think 
on—that he would give a reward for each one.


¶23] 
Thereupon there come to us the descendant of Niall 
of Callann and the race of *Eóghan*; and the ancient 
hazel-tree of Ulster's plain was full of reproach for our art.


¶24] 
The son of Niall O'Neill did not lift his kindly, 
gracious countenance, or his keen, heavy-browed, active 
eye to the poets of Eber's land.


¶25] 
From the sole of his soft, smooth, springing foot 
to his fine, abundant locks Turlogh's handsome, brilliant 
form became a crimson mass.


¶26] 
We all filled with fear of the high-king of *Conchobhar*'s 
race, for the red-lipped hero of *Bóroimhe* was thoroughly
angered.


¶27] 
We attempted with pleasant speeches to distract 
his mind, seeking to turn away his wrath, but that availed 
us nothing.


¶28] 
The award we asked was conceded to us by the 
descendant of Nine-fettered Niall, but the noble chief of 
*Monadh*'s, host would not hearken to one stanza of our art.


¶29] Ever since he hath borne an unchanging aspect 
of fierce anger, and the king of *Fál*'s noble, 
vigorous race hath found no abatement of it.




---

p.37


¶30] 
I ask of the high-king of *Oileach*, if it be timely 
to ask it; what caused the keen wrath from which the 
fierce glow arose in his fair countenance?


¶31] 
Wherefore this great anger which afflicts the son 
of Niall, in spite of having well rewarded everyone? 
What hath caused his clear countenance to flame, or was 
there any cause?


¶32] 
If one might say it to himself, as regards this great 
wrath which afflicts the son of noble Niall, he hath no 
reason for it; the easier is it to enkindle it.


¶33] 
His race are as dearly ransomed at the mouth of 
the Erne as by the limpid streams of the fair Finn, and 
the sweetly-murmuring *Trágh Báile*.


¶34] 
Equally is he obeyed at the Drowes and at the 
Ards, at the glistening streams of *Srúbh Breagh* and at 
the green-banked Boyne by *Tailte*.


¶35] 
I do not find that the curly-haired king of fair 
Derg hath any reason for anger, but territories submitting 
to him, including kings and assemblies of Ulster [4](javascript:footNote('T402563/note004.html')).


¶36] It is this alone, I know well, that causes the anger 
of the white-fingered, sleek-browed man, that no one 
recited to O'Neill a battle-roll of his exploits.


¶37] 
He would be waiting for them till the day of Doom, 
if the poets of Ireland were to versify the distant forays 
of the mighty and spirited one; the hostings and combats 
of Turlogh.


¶38] However, if all the people of Ireland were united 
against them they would be in no danger as long as he 
were on their side; in no place does any dare to contend 
with him.[5](javascript:footNote('T402563/note005.html'))

To *Cú Chonnacht* Maguire
-------------------------


¶1] 
Free people are the seed of Colla, champions of 
*Liathdruim*'s homestead; stags of the royal herd from 
Conn's castle, vineblossoms from Frewin.


¶2] 
Manannans of western Europe, pure seed in kindly 
soil; smooth-fingered warriors from the stately Boyne of 
Bregia, twining stems of the bright host of the Gael.


¶3] 
Shore-defenders of-the Plain of the Fair, Ireland's 
'Children of Israel,' little does it profit to strive against 
their fortune—sustaining pillars of the House of Tara.


¶4] 
Furnace sparks from the mouth of a forge, deep, 
diluvian waves; mighty warriors to give battle, set stones 
of the land.


¶5] 
Favored children of the host of *Banbha*, fierce fiery 
heroes; few are the like of the men amongst the 
contenders *(?)* of Gall or Gael.


¶6] 
Never have we heard of any kindred fit to be pitted 
against the race of Colla from the confines of Oriel, or 
of any Irishmen such as they.


¶7] 
There has not been nor will there ever be found—
what avails it to discuss them?—a perfect simile of the 
noble Ulstermen from the Bregian Boyne.


¶8] 
There is but one tale about the seed of Colla, the 
race of *Eachaid*h—that the heroes lost possession of 
Ireland by force of their exploits.


¶9] 
Of their own will the proud race of *Eachaidh Doimlén* 
have relinquished the kingship of *Fál*'s corn-abounding 
plain in exchange for other privileges.




---

p.39


¶10] Since the days of our ancestors the three *Oirghialla* 
of Bregia's soil have ever held privileges innumerable 
beyond *(others of)* the five blue regions of the Gael.


¶11] 
The king of the *Oirghialla* has not only the right 
to sit next to the king of Ireland, but I should think less 
of the best of the *Oirghialla* did he seek this privilege.


¶12] 
The plentifully attended king of Colla's tribe keeps 
vacant *(at table)* the space of his sword's length and his 
long hand between him and the freemen.


¶13] 
The kindred of noble Colla are entitled to a third 
of the honorprice, a third of the tribute and a third of 
the tax of *Fearadhach*'s Plain, to be divided amongst 
them by the man.


¶14] 
They are entitled—what an achievement—from 
November to summer to quarter their steeds and their 
hounds from house to house on the plain of *Teathbha*.


¶15] 
The king of Tara can claim from the *Oirghialla*—
and did he mention any more he would not get it—once 
in three years a hosting of but six weeks.


¶16] 
Even as regards that claim upon the kingly seed 
of generous Colla, he does not send a man to bind their 
agreements throughout summer or autumn.


¶17] 
The wealth which any of them loses when he joins 
the high-king's army, the princely champion is bound 
to find seven times its value.


¶18] 
Twenty-one cows are due to every man from 
the firm king of the fair Gaels, when they are returning 
home from that army; an award which has ennobled 
*Eachaidh*'s descendant.


¶19] 
Thirty blades—no small gift—thirty mantles, thirty 
steeds and thirty sharp elfin spears as well, from the 
king of Ireland to *Eachaidh*'s descendant.


¶20] 
Despite the prohibition of the king of Inisfail, the 
shrewd lords of the Plain of *Eithne* can safeguard criminals 
for a year beyond the just term of protection.

p.40


¶21] 
If they are accused of crimes, this is what the high 
king of Ireland can have, the oath of the defendant in 
the case of every offence committed by the race of 
*Eachaidh*.


¶22] 
The learned ones of Bregia's land say that the king 
of the Field of the Gael gets no further homage from the 
warriors of the *Oirghialla* than an exchange of hostages.


¶23] 
Moreover the hostages of Colla's bright-sworded 
kin are entitled to take counsel with all in order to 
find the meaning of their judgment *(?)*.


¶24] 
The soldiery from the House of Tara have no chain 
or iron ring confining slender hand or foot, nor is there 
a man's body *(of theirs)* in stone prison.


¶25] 
They are not to be ironed, the captives from the 
line of noble Colla; it is enough to take their pledges, 
all agree that they may have their liberty.


¶26] 
Each man has the attire of a chieftain when returning 
from the king of Tara, a privilege granted to the nobly 
feasting *Oirghialla* beyond other mighty hostages of the 
men of Ireland.


¶27] 
They have gold on the hilts of their blades, gold 
on the rims of their helmets; of fine-spun gold are their
garments, the hostages from Bregia's dewy castle.


¶28] 
Therefore are they, rather than any other Gaels 
known as 'golden hostages', of ruddy gold are the 
fetters of their hostages when the *Oirghialla* are returning 
home.


¶29] 
When returning from the king of Ireland they have 
not so much as the heads of their javelins, the thongs 
of their spears or the fine greaves of their legs but is gold.


¶30] 
It is the right of the seed of Colla of smooth 
goblets that the men of Ireland should rise up before 
them, but they, warriors with whom women readily 
make peace, are not bound to arise.

¶31] 
Such privilege have they obtained from the king 
of Ireland that a hand is not dipped in a golden basin, 
nor yet is palm of hand or sole of foot cleansed therein 
until they have first washed in it.


¶32] 
In Tara of the hostages, then, it is not lawful that 
any bathe before the high-king of the *Oirghialla* shall 
have done so, or that any other man should be assigned 
an apartment in the sleeping house before him.


¶33] 
The high king of the land of Bregia might not 
seat himself until he should have sat, nor arise from 
wine until the champion of the Erne arose.


¶34] A third of Ulster, the great third of Connacht, 
according to the boundary, was the original share of the 
wine-quaffing race of Colla amongst the lords of *Fál*.


¶35] 
The Erne, the Finn, the Boyne and the Bann, and 
each territory that lies between them—brown-nutted soils 
where the sun shines—these are the boundaries of the 
land of the *Oirghialla*.


¶36] 
The privileges of Colla's seed have ceased; the 
fighting men of *Liathdruim* do not remember what hath 
long been owing to them from the peoples of *Tailte*.


¶37] 
Even were it feasible to claim it the *Oirghialla* do 
not seek to obtain from *Fiacha*'s kindred the due which 
was rightfully theirs.


¶38] 
It is not loss of power or of memory that affects 
the youths of Mourne; what is the reason that the privileges 
of *Banbha*'s bright-haired scions are withheld?


¶39] 
Many are their breachmakers of battle, many their 
stuff of high chieftains, sufficient is the abundancy of 
their warriors, the great host of *Maighin*'s fertile plain.


¶40] 
That they themselves do not unite, that, you would
say, is the reason their rights are withheld from the three 
hosts of the Plain of *Codhal*.




---

p.42


¶41] 
There is good reason for resisting the power of 
the progeny of bold *Eachaidh Doimlén*—the seed of Colla 
are in three divisions, with a several king over each 
band of them.


¶42] 
A king over the seed of *Mathghamhain* from Moira, 
a king over the seed of *Maine*, son of *Eachaidh*, a king 
over the men of Fermanagh's bending woods, have the 
bright battalions of the men of Oriel.


¶43] 
It is wrong to have three kings over the seed of 
Colla, it is a cause of weakness; it were better to be 
depending on a single man, as a shepherd to all in general.


¶44] 
The three equal battalions of the kindred of Colla, 
warriors of Bregia's dewy mount, would do well to appoint 
a single man to rule them.


¶45] 
As for the true patrimony of Colla's tribe let the 
three royal bands deliver the kingship of the bright, 
blue-soiled plain, into the keeping of one man of the *Oirghialla*.


¶46] 
Why do not the race of *Eachaidh* put their trust in 
a valiant, rightly-judging king, over whom none *(of theirs)* 
of the wondrous line of *Fiacha* would have any degree 
of superiority?


¶47] 
Let the three noble battalions of Colla's seed elect 
one king amongst them, according to wisdom and shrewdness; 
according to age and dignity.


¶48] 
What ails them that they confide not in *Cú Chonnacht*, 
son of *Cú Chonnacht* scion [*...*]*(?)* of the House of the 
Three, guarding champion of his kin.


¶49] 
The only levying steward of the three battalions 
is the righteous king of Fermanagh; gently-moving foot, 
save when meeting spear-points, enemy to the wrongs 
of Ireland.


¶50] 
*Cú Chonnacht Óg* Maguire, protecting shield to his 
soldiers; senior of the seed of Colla *Dá Chríoch*, their 
surety for peace or for war.

p.43


¶51] Most precious jewel of Conn's Half, heir of great 
*Donn*, son of *Domhnall*, a man whom the wealth of this 
world never beguiled, the best nourisher of art.


¶52] 
Counsellor in war of Bregia's land, chief of peace 
of the host of the Gael; a king who entwines the fair 
men of *Fál*, the fulfilment of *Bearchán*'s prophecy.


¶53] 
Let your three united battalions assemble with 
*Cú Chonnacht*, the great host of *Eachaidh*'s descendants, 
valiant, rightly-judging kindred.


¶54] 
This is the intention of Joan's son, upon the coming 
of the three royal gatherings; to go and inspect the plain 
of Niall, it shall profit both them and him.


¶55] 
A man from fair *Cliú* shall recognize the son of 
great *Cú Chonnacht*, son of Brian's son, [6](javascript:footNote('T402563/note006.html')) as chieftain over 
your battalions, O fair kindred of *Eachaidh*.


¶56] 
From the beginning to the end of the world, ye 
have not found, nor will ye find a more princely chief 
than this king, ye three patrimonies of Oriel.


¶57] 
Son of Joan, and *Cú Chonnacht*—what king might 
one compare with him? a heart from which hardness 
hath parted, the latest generation of kindliness.

To Maguire
----------


¶1] 
Fermanagh is the hearthstone of hospitality; its men 
are more generous than hospitality itself; it is a land 
that hath put forth every goodly crop, a fount for the 
hospitality of all others.


¶2] For repute and hospitality there is not their like in 
*Banbha*; fame hath ever preferred the blood of *Odhar* 
beyond any in the Western Land.


¶3] The chieftain of the Manchian plain merits every 
gage of hospitality that may be found; it were fitting 
that those who journey *Cobhthach*'s Plain should deliver 
to him the gages of all others.


¶4] Short is the time of his opponent [*...*][7](javascript:footNote('T402563/note007.html')) as the sea 
excels the tiny pool so doth he excel the pledgeworthy 
of *Féilim*'s blood.


¶5] 
The day Maguire is at his worst he overshadows 
the growth of other men's fame; their equal in one man 
confronts the choicest of the Gaels of the western land.


¶6] His word is enough to curb the host of *Banbha* 
when they are rallied in ranks of battle; from the wrath 
of the king of *Fiacha*'s land peace is made in five 
countries.


¶7] It behoves not Ireland to be independent of the 
king of *Odhar*'s race; the seed of Conn is powerful either 
to succour or to spoil the lords of the western land.


¶8] By his bold words a king was proclaimed through 
territories; a man banished by the seed of *Séadna* did 
not find shelter throughout *Fódla*.




---

p.45


¶9] 
Reavers dare not attack the Manchians of Gowra's 
Field; if the king of *Eamhain* be there he wards off those 
in the pass.


¶10] Heroes by whom the Dwelling of *Tuathal*'s secured, 
whom no man is found to face; the blood of *Fiachaidh* 
earn fame in the fighting, even when unwithstood.


¶11] 
They rule Ireland without reproach, from one corner 
of the western land; there is not sufficient might against 
them to attempt to spoil the race of *Odhar*.


¶12] 
*Cú Chonnacht*, by his qualities, deserved to be 
chosen beyond the Children of *Míl*; a king is made from 
the seed of Bonn in preference to *(all)* the kings of Eber's 
land.


¶13] 
The king of the Erne can balance every known 
pledge of honour; it were a small pledge for the person 
of the Manchian if the pledge of *(all)* *Cobhthach*'s Fold 
were got.


¶14] 
One would get from him at the feast a payment 
which should be denied every guest; the hospitality of 
Craoidhe's blood bears a repute which all Ireland never 
bore.


¶15] Consider has there or will there come a fortune 
which their exploits do not overwhelm; to people of 
repute the very faults of the host from *Bearta*'s brink 
were matter for great praise.


¶16] 
With them is the custody of hospitality, to guard 
it from the western warriors; even if those against them 
be of the best the blood of *Odhar* will surpass them.


¶17] 
That which has been uttered in time of feasting 
is not denied when slumber is past; were an enemy 
seeking justice he never on that account made a biased 
award.


¶18] 
A cup brimming with the contents of goblets, it 
could not be tackled without a gathering of champions; 
the empty horn of the champion of Ulster brought a 
strong man's hand to the ground.




---

p.46


¶19] 
Greatly did the wonted trouble increase when 
*Banbha* was shepherdless; he goes to the House of *Tuathal*, 
that has removed the curse of the slaying of *Fiachaidh*.


¶20] 
The land of the Gael is thine as far as it extends, 
it is no boast for Maguire; since thou art pledged for 
the seed of Conn there is an end to spoiling in the 
western land.


¶21] 
Thou causest all *Banbha* to be without either reaver 
or watchman; all are thanking thee that no one is at 
the mercy of any other.


¶22] 
The race of Eremon and Eber have become one 
assembly; it enhances the exploit that it is no marvel 
that the Gaels themselves should do it for thee.


¶23] 
None but the soldiery of the Erne confront thee 
when rising forth upon the western land; not that one 
fears to oppose thee, but if it be gained it is by the blood 
of *Odhar*.


¶24] 
When thou comest single-handed into the conflict 
thou needest no exhortation; thou in the pass alone hadst 
power by which the Field of the Gaels was delivered.


¶25] 
Thy exploits on the brink of the pass suffice to 
guard them; on thy account the spoilers of *Connla*'s 
land pass through it unarmed.


¶26] 
In thy castle, Maguire, knowledge of territories is 
got from exacting companies; without quitting thy side 
a poet explores the whole of the western land.


¶27] 
Thou, from the extremity of the Irish soil, dost 
apportion the five lands; but a small thing mentioned by 
thee causes the hosting of the Sons of *Míl*.


¶28] 
The kings of Bregia are in thy steading in bands 
at feasting time, thou concealest under *(as it were)* a 
shelter of foliage *(?)* the royal throne of every other man.


¶29] 
The labour of thy sword hilt in the field of danger 
has spared thy companions; thy approach to the perilous 
pass robs *(?)* something of each man's vigour.




---

p.47


¶30] 
In the time which poets do not appropriate the 
others wait in thy presence; the leaders of hosts, while 
they are before thee, do not get an opportunity with thee.


¶31] 
The pledge of *Banbha* comes to thee, the utterance 
of the prophets hath been confirmed; no man is envious 
because the Gaels look for thy crowning.


¶32] 
Bending trees in the place of the pools which the 
dry weather hath emptied; by reason of the produce it 
hath cast on the strand the sea of the Champions' Plain 
is empty.


¶33] 
A winding stream through a wood brown with nuts, 
a hostage in fetters was never slower; the low bending 
trunks, the shallow wave, are charters of ownership on 
*Féilim*'s land.


¶34] 
The envious could not discern any thing which 
would be a reproach to the royal line; the seed of *Donn*, 
*(even)* their enemies declare, are entitled to the tribute of 
*Úna*'s soil.


¶35] 
The champions from *Oileach*'s land were not 
dreaded by the western country; without the wasting 
of any territory *Odhar*'s blood subdued five kings.


¶36] 
When they had enkindled every land it was not 
long till a country was succoured by them; the peaceful 
humour of *Fiacha*'s blood pacified five territories.


¶37] 
In *Connla*'s Land there is no refuge for him, till 
he have requited *(even)* the damage he did not commit; 
the reaver is accepted in no part of *Banbha*, because of 
this new hound of *Eamhain*.


¶38] 
*Banbha* is guarded, though it be difficult, without 
violence or enmity; no man has accused the blood of 
*Odhar* of spoiling the Gaels.


¶39] 
The seed of *Connla* does not hoard up its great 
gifts, golden bracelets have completed their time with it 
the day they are fashioned.




---

p.48


¶40] After surveying the generosity of others never did 
poet cool towards the warriors of *Oileach*; having inspected 
the whole of Eber's land he makes for the tribe of *Donn*.


¶41] 
*Cú Chonnacht*'s vow protects them when they have 
served like the Collas; the pledges of their fighting 
men are released throughout *Banbha* by the warriors of 
*Eamhain*.


¶42] 
After the battle the hostages of *Fódla* are proclaimed 
on the green of his castle, in the house of the hostages 
thou wilt find tidings of every man in *Úna*'s land.


¶43] 
There is no danger of reaving on the coast, there 
is no door to a hostel; the steward of Conn's descendant 
is secure of tribute on the foot-hills of the western soil.


¶44] 
Hotter is every palm than the sparks from the all 
but molten mass in smithy; weary must be the legs and 
arms of the soldiery of *Rath* on returning from the battle.

Enniskillen
-----------


¶1] 
Alas for him who looks on Enniskillen, with its 
glistening bays and melodious falls; it is perilous for us, 
since one cannot forsake it, to look upon the fair castle, 
with its shining sward.


¶2] Long ere ever I came to the white-walled rampart 
amongst the blue hillocks it seemed to me if I could reach 
that house I should lack nothing.


¶3] 
I heard, alas for me that heard it, such repute of 
the fairy castle of surpassing treasure, and how my 
beguilement was in store, that it was impossible to turn 
me back from it.


¶4] 
This was the saying of each man regarding the 
splendid dwelling of the lion of the Erne—no man in 
*Banbha* ever saw a dwelling to equal it.


¶5] 
And they used to say moreover, whosoever should 
see the bending wood or the verdant slope, the level 
beach or the green field, would not take one step away 
from it.


¶6] 
After hearing its description when I had slept for a 
while I beheld no other vision save the splendor of the 
noble spacious dwelling.


¶7] I proceed on my way, I reach Enniskillen of the overhanging 
oaks; through the fair plain of bending, 
fruit-laden stems I was in no wise loth to approach it.


¶8] 
Ere I arrived beside the place I was startled at the 
tumult; the baying of their lively hounds and their 
hunting-dogs driving deer from the wood for them.




---

p.50


¶9] 
The strand beside the court, on the fairy-like bay 
of murmuring streams, was crowded with such groves 
of tapering ship-masts that they concealed the beach and 
its waves.


¶10] 
And hard by that enclosure I see a lovely plain 
of golden radiance, the moist-surfaced lawn of the 
bright-hued castle, the soil of Paradise, or else its very 
counterpart.


¶11] 
Thus did I find the green of the castle—upturned 
by the hooves of steeds; from the prancing of horses 
competing for triumph no herb flourishes in the soil of 
the outer yard.


¶12] The horses of the castle *(were)* running in contest, 
again I see them coursing one by one, until the surrounding 
hills were hidden, no mist upon them save an expanse *(?)*
of steeds.


¶13] 
I make directly for the coupled fortress of the 
branch of *Lie*; those whom I found in the fair mansion—
a wondrous content of a mansion were they.


¶14] I found the nobles of the race of Colla in the 
thronged court distributing treasure, and those who exposed 
the recondities of the genealogy of the Grecian Gaels.


¶15] I found, moreover, throughout the fortress plenty 
of poets and minstrels, from one bright, white-surfaced 
wall to the other—happy the dwelling in which they 
find room!


¶16] 
In the other division I found plenty of slender-lipped, 
satin-clad maidens, weaving wondrous golden fringes 
in the sportive *(?)* rampart with fair, sleek hounds.


¶17] 
All through the house is an abundance of soldiery, 
reclining by the side walls; their edged weapons hanging 
above the fighters, warriors of fruitful *Druim Caoin*.


¶18] 
A mighty band of elfin youth, either from the 
Fairy-mound of *Bodhbh* or from Lear's Hostel, such that 
eye dared not regard them because of their splendor, 
were on the battlements of the bright, wooded rampart.




---

p.51


¶19] 
A company of artificers binding vessels, a company 
of smiths preparing weapons; a company of wrights that 
were not from one land at work upon her—fair pearl of 
babbling streams.


¶20] 
Dyeing of textures, polishing of blades, fitting of 
javelins, exercising of steeds; captives in surety, drawing 
up of conditions, scholars surveying the list of kings.


¶21] 
Taking of hostages, releasing of hostages; healing 
of warriors, wounding of warriors; continual bringing in 
and giving out of treasure at the wondrous, smooth, comely,
firm, castle.


¶22] 
Part of that day they spent in talking of exploits, 
in meditating on battle; and a while would be spent 
by the host of Ushnagh in feasting, in listening to 
music.


¶23] 
Thus till supper-time we spent the whole of the 
fair day in the bright, green-swarded, fertile enclosure; 
as one hour in length did that day seem to us.


¶24] 
All began to seat themselves by the smooth walls 
of the white rampart; hardly in any hostel is there a 
number to equal the party that was therein.


¶25] 
*Cú Chonnacht Óg*, son of *Cú Chonnacht*, supple form 
to which smoke clings, when all that were in his hostel 
have sat down he seats himself on his regal seat.


¶26] I sat on the right hand of the champion of Tara 
till the circling of goblets was over; though it had its 
due of nobles the king's elbow never disdained me.


¶27] 
After a while, when it was time for those in the 
castle to take their rest, beds of down were prepared for 
the noblest of the alert, instructed host.


¶28] 
Ere day overtook the people of the hostel a band 
of them were fitting spears; at daybreak horse-shoes *(?)* 
were being fitted within and men were going to catch steeds.

p.52


¶29] 
Shortly after sleep I see around the hawk of *Síoth
Truim* the picked ones of all in panoply of battle, in the 
gloomless, stone-built, firmly-standing court.


¶30] 
Ere the coming of morn the valiant youth of the 
king's court set out from us; a great, lengthy, dense, 
spear-armed mass, ignorant they of making treaties of peace.


¶31] 
It was not long until the gold-ringletted race of 
Colla rejoined us, after completely subduing every territory, 
happy the kingdom which is their homeland.


¶32] 
That day around Loch Erne there is many a 
stranger woman whose husband is no more; many figures 
of wounded hostages coming in after the conflict.


¶33] 
Precious treasures there were in that dwelling, 
which had not been theirs at the beginning of day: and 
hard by the place there were cattle which had not been 
near them the night before.


¶34] 
Then were the poets of the castle rewarded by 
*Eachaidh*'s descendant, who never shrank from combat: 
small harm was the dearness of their poesy, riches had 
been got beyond what he allowed to them.


¶35] 
I went with the school to take leave of Maguire; 
away from the lofty, brightly appointed court, alas that 
he suffered me to go.


¶36] 
When parting from me, he said, shedding tears down 
his brown cheek, even though I might not be near to 
the warrior, that he was not parting from me for good.


¶37] 
I remember that the day I turned my back on the 
household of the king's dwelling, such sorrow lay upon 
them all that the grief of any one of them was not distinct.


¶38] 
None the better am I that that household is no 
more, would I had consumed the end of my days; lest 
I be longlived after they have gone, it is perilous to me 
that I shall survive.




---

p.53


¶39] Never have I heard of a household so noble as 
that in the castle—what excellence—under any that sprang 
from the Collas; that is the pronouncement of every poet 
regarding it.


¶40] 
Lifford of the bright lawns, none ever quits it of 
his own free will; since it beguiles to the place a man 
from every quarter—alas for him that beholds it.

Hugh Maguire
------------


¶1] 
I shall leave Hugh to the men of Ireland, they are 
enough for the white-handed one of the fine, soft hair; 
save myself alone all Ireland is his; he is her comrade, 
her companion.


¶2] 
I should not find room by Hugh, the best poets of 
the Irishmen are around him on every side; they do not 
permit me to approach *Criomhthan*'s descendant.


¶3] 
No matter, that is no harm; I shall look to Maguire 
to see if my king of Gowra will accept me since I am 
alone.


¶4] 
I must needs approach, even if it be wrong, the 
high-king of Fermanagh's soil; we have been forestalled 
with Hugh, supple-handed, foam-white form.


¶5] 
A curious little story concerning this I shall relate 
to Hugh Maguire—bright, fair-hued countenance fore 
which the wave ebbs—for which it were unjust to 
reproach me.


¶6] 
Seventeen of the poets of Ulster went to study their 
art, the destination of the fair Ultonian band being 
Kilcloney in Connacht.


¶7] 
They purchased a pig and a beef, and forthwith these 
people I have mentioned, each of them in quarrelsome 
humor, began to apportion their shares.


¶8] 
The man of the house asked which of the undistinguished, 
bashful company should be set down to the 
beef, and which to the long, fat, substantial pig.




---

p.55


¶9] 
Unanimously they make for the pork, out of that 
senseless band there was only one man got for the beef, 
though it was a crazy proceeding.


¶10] 'May I never come back alive,' said one of them, 
turning, 'it has parted me from this company of friends, 
I shall go to the sharp, bony thing.'


¶11] 
Of the seventeen men—keen the liking—none 
selected the clear, succulent beef in the end save a single 
man; it was not possible to restrain them.


¶12] 
Consider, thou soft and white of bosom, how 
abundant [*...*]*(?)* caused only one man to forsake the 
pork, thou shepherd of Cormac's Plain.


¶13] 
Today, thou son of Maguire, it is no fault in me 
not to approach thee; I am loth to celebrate thy praises 
amongst all the poets of Ireland.


¶14] 
Not rumors of niggardliness, not disagreement with 
thee, or hatred or distrust of thee, thou smooth-cheeked, 
wondrous, graceful one, keeps thee perpetually cut off 
from me, but *(my)* sulkiness.


¶15] 
Good as thou art, I would not forsake for thee 
my own man, *Cú Chonnacht*; my strength, my love, my 
affection; he would never abandon me.

To Brian Maguire
----------------


¶1] Fermanagh is the Paradise of *Fódla*, a tranquil, 
fruitful plain; land of bright, dry, fertile fields, formed 
like the havens of Paradise.


¶2] 
The murmuring of her waters is heavenly melody, 
her soil bears golden blossom, the sweetness of her rivers 
is a vision of sweet honey, the tresses of her wood 
turning them back.


¶3] 
Gentle valleys beyond arable *(?)* plains, blue streams 
above the valleys, overhanging the flowers is a 
yellow-nutted forest covered with golden foliage.


¶4] 
Enough to take sickness from a man were the brownness 
of her branches, the blue of her waters, the 
ruddiness of her foliage, the gloomlessness of her clouds; 
heavenly is her soil and sky.


¶5] 
Like to the melodies of Paradise around the tender, 
blue-springed country is the murmuring of her pure, 
sand-bedded streams mingling with the angelic voice of 
her birdflocks.


¶6] 
No tongue—in short—can tell half her delight, land 
of shallow streams and clustering, succulent crops, what 
is it but the very Paradise of Ireland?


¶7] 
None interfereth with any other in this pleasant 
earthly Paradise; there is none bent on spoil, nor any 
man suffering from injustice.


¶8] 
Every man, moreover, finds in her glance a smile 
of love, so that even a veritable foe, if he enter, is not 
ready to do her harm.

p.57


¶9] 
There is no reavers' track in the grass, or trace of 
spectres in the air, or of monsters in the waters about 
the noble, gifted, dyked plain.


¶10] 
There are no ghosts in her woods, or serpent in her 
fens; no misfortune threatening her cattle, no spoiler 
plundering her.


¶11] 
They dare not traverse her beyond her boundary-dykes; 
little recks the bright, blue region of any of the 
spoilers of Eber's Land.


¶12] 
This land around Gowra's Field hath obtained by 
wondrous magic powers something that protects it so 
that it cannot be plundered.


¶13] It is not the properties of stones, nor is it the veil 
of wizardry, that guards the waters of its far-spread lands; 
it is not the smooth slopes, or the wood, nor is it the 
sorcerous arts of druids.


¶14] They have a better protection for all the boundaries
—a shepherd sufficient for everyone is the man—one 
alone is their guard.


¶15] 
Brian Maguire of the bared weapons, son of 
*Donnchadh*, son of *Cú Chonnacht*; guarding buckler of 
Donn's Land, own fosterling of the fairy mound of 
*Sioghmhall*.


¶16] 
Towards Ulster he is the ocean's surface; towards 
Connacht a rampart of stone; comrade of the gentle, 
maidenly women of Bregia, boundary dyke of the two 
provinces.


¶17] 
A healing herb for the blood of *Eachaidh*; a gate 
of death to the Breffnians; a fiery bolt to the blood of 
Niall and to the *Oirghialla* of the other side.


¶18] 
Fermanagh of the fortunate ramparts is the Adam's 
Paradise of Inisfail; the descendant of the noblemen 
Bregia's castle is as the fiery wall surrounding it.

¶19] 
If a single prey were taken from the race of Conn 
between the Erne and *Áth Conaill*, compensation for the 
spoilings inflicted on them would be got from the four 
quarters of Ireland.


¶20] 
He would not leave a dwelling unwrecked by the 
fertile banks of the Boyne, by the warm, bright, gentle 
Moy, or the very shores of *Bearnas*.


¶21] 
Equally would he lay waste the smooth hills around 
Creeveroe, and the wondrous country from Croghan of 
Conn as far as the borders of Corann.


¶22] 
It were attacking a dwelling of bees, or putting 
the hand into a serpent's nest, to plunder the man of his 
ancestral land—or it were to approach a blazing house.


¶23] 
Long hath she been watching for Brian himself to 
come to her aid; since every soothsayer hath foretold 
his coming to the bright, angelic plain.


¶24] 
Once upon a time the Greeks endured like this 
for a certain space, in great and grievous trouble, trusting 
to find help.


¶25] 
The flower of the men of the world march on 
warlike, valiant Greece, making upon her simultaneously, 
so that they deprived her of her magic *(protection)*.


¶26] Since the youth of Greece had no means of giving 
battle, the king of the exceedingly valorous host said 
that they should abandon their fatherland forthwith.


¶27] 
'Do not abandon it,' said the Grecian soothsayers; 
'it were better to keep your country; for people of your 
prowess it is a shameful thing to be ready to forsake 
your inheritance.'


¶28] 
And then spake one of the druids: 'All the fitter 
is it to preserve the land since there is one in store for 
it who shall be a shepherd over the whole world.'

¶29] 
'A babe to-day,' said he, 'is the man that shall 
deliver us; if we but endure the wrong we get, shortly 
shall we gain relief.'


¶30] 
'Name to us more clearly,' replied the rest, as one 
man, 'who is, or will you trace to his origin the one you 
would say can accomplish it?'


¶31] 
The druid replied—sufficing weal—'great Hercules, 
the Grecian champion, it is he I have named as a protector 
for all, by virtue of his powers and fortune.'


¶32] 
'The armies of all the world,' he continued, 'will 
gather under the terrifying, wondrous hero, the glowing 
form named Hercules, this fruitful palm-tree of a promised 
*(deliverer)*.'


¶33] 
'No monsters, no human creatures shall have such 
strength as to attempt to contend with him or tell 
of the gains*(?)* of his kindred.'


¶34] 
The druid who had spoken thus decided as a 
counsel for his friend that until that fair, bright, eager
countenance appear, they endure the ordinances of all the 
islands.


¶35] 
'If ye do as I say,' said the sage, 'until Hercules 
come to manhood, all that the three continents have 
exacted is naught but a loan from us.'


¶36] 
'We care not what wrongs, dangers or perils we 
undergo provided there is a prospect of help in store 
for us;' replied every one.


¶37] 
As for the Grecian high-king, he endured every 
ordinance that was imposed upon him, till the coming 
of the prowess of Hercules—ruddy, bright, soft cheek, 
never wont to do ill.


¶38] Nine queens of the Greeks [*...*][8](javascript:footNote('T402563/note008.html')) him, in order 
to hasten his maturity, a most promising company for his 
guarding.

¶39] 
Never, moreover, would he leave the knee or the 
bosom of the high-king, such care had he for him; no 
negligent guarding had Hercules.


¶40] 
Thereafter it was not long till Hercules subdued 
the choicest of the world; what need to recount the deeds 
of the man—? he confirmed the prophecies of the druid.


¶41] 
He overcame the people of the world, he punished 
them for their unjust dealings; the Grecian treasures came 
back to him with a hundredfold increase.


¶42] Well did it serve his kinsfolk to wait for him in 
his youth—but why should I continue? Hercules is famed 
for his adventures.


¶43] 
Even thus were the far-raiding race of Colla as 
regards Brian, waiting for the ripening of his bright cheek 
sometime in his boyhood.


¶44] 
So that the men of Fermanagh, moreover, spent 
a time sorrowfully and woefully, ever watching for the 
royal champion of the men of *Oileach*.


¶45] 
So that he was nourished—most fortunately—on 
the lap of Fermanagh's high-king, and by shining, white-handed 
women, this Hercules of the Sons of *Míl*.


¶46] 
Until he filled with courage from the excellence 
of his nourishing—ruddy cheek by whom peace is readily 
rejected and from his nursing in the bosom of the 
high-king.


¶47] 
So that there came to them after that the son of 
*Donnchadh*, son of Maguire, to rescue them, under omens 
propitious for the succour of his kindred.


¶48] 
As for the race of Colla, the tribe of *Eóghan* have 
levied and will levy what they owe by charter the blood 
of Colla.


¶49] Colla's race of *Dá Thí*'s, Plain, these chieftains of 
Bregia have kept in their minds every decree that was 
made, in the hope of avenging it at last.

¶50] 
They cared not what wrong they should suffer from 
Ulster or from Connacht, since against the brigandage 
of Ireland, help awaited them.


¶51] 
Now will they demand satisfaction *(?)* for their 
grudges, from Ulster, from the territory of Connacht; 
since the prophesied Brian hath come reavers are marching 
from the north.


¶52] 
In front of all will come that son of Hugh's daughter, 
strong hand from which the javelin glistens, the Hercules 
of western Europe.

Cathal O'Conor
--------------


¶1] 
Let us make a reckoning, *Cathal*, of riches and of 
poetry; the occasion for making it is a heart's torment, 
thou star from the Plain of Calry.


¶2] This is a common saying, thou kindly countenance—
'affection ends with the casting up of accounts;' it is not 
an utterance without sorrow for me, thou capital of hospitality 
to men of letters.


¶3] 
It is time for us to balance accounts—and yet, O 
star-soft eye and glowing cheek, O beloved of women, 
it was not timely for me that it should be done.


¶4] 
Too early for me didst thou determine to go into 
the reckoning, the end of my affection is a cause of grief, 
unhappy for me is the determination.


¶5] 
A bargain of gifts and of poetry I used to make 
with thee, O ruddy, gentle contenance, as was proper for 
me and for thee; sad is my share of the bargain.


¶6] 
There is no shape of all those which our craft has 
ever taken that I did not make for thy waving locks, 
from the poem to the weaving of a single stanza, thou 
noble chieftain of the host of Sligo.


¶7] 
There is no art, from playing the musical branches 
to the relating of soothing stories, and from that to 
extolling thy race, that thou didst not get from me.


¶8] 
Let us now make a reckoning anew, let me hear 
from thee how thou didst requite every quality in which 
I served thee, thou surety for foray of the Plain of Cormac.




---

p.63


¶9] 
What is this silence which is upon thee, Cathal 
O'Conor, that thou recountest not against me whatever 
was bestowed upon me?


¶10] 
Why, son of Tadhg, dost thou not boast of all 
that I obtained from thee, thou bright and noble of 
presence, as a balance of my great account with thee, 
thou soft-haired hero of Bangor?


¶11] 
Were everything that thou hast granted to me put 
in the account, thou mighty ox of this land of Bregia, 
it were not easy to reckon it up.


¶12] 
The spur-strap and the belt would be got from 
thee, Cathal, mantle and goblet and steeds, thou scion of 
Sligo.


¶13] 
Alas, alas, one would get mares and the precious 
stone from thy slender hand, and the gilded horn and 
the ring, thou chieftain of the great plain of *Murbhach*.


¶14] 
Cattle would be got from thee, O clinging locks, 
land moreover, and the shepherding of those cattle, thou 
defending shield of the waters of Duff.


¶15] 
I found a hundred times as much from thee, thou 
red-lipped, gently-speaking one, it is not the various 
wealth I received therefore that should be set against me.


¶16] 
Rather should thy favor be recounted, and thy 
prudent, kindly care, thou hostage of the fair Plain of 
*Fál*; more fitting were it to recount thy love and thy 
esteem.


¶17] 
I used to have thy confidence and thy counsel, 
thou branch of Leyney, thy elbow and half thy couch, 
an award which no gifts could excel.


¶18] 
It were just to give thanks for it to thee—from 
others, Cathal, I got plenteous gifts in consequence of 
being seen beside thee.


¶19] 
I could not recount, O bright face, one half of 
what I received amongst the host of the fair Dwelling 
of *Fál*, from appealing in thy honor.




---

p.64


¶20] 
Through thee I got my price from Clanwilliam 
to the west, and, another time, from the battalion of 
Breffney, thou twining stem of the host of Sligo.


¶21] 
I got—though I deserved it not—my share of the 
wealth of Conall's race, and of the booty of the O'Neills 
from the east, on account of thee, O waving, parted-locks.


¶22] 
The Costellos, the *Gaileangaigh*, would be spared 
for rewarding me; *Chlann Chúán* and Carra must needs 
favor us.


¶23] 
From Erne's water to Slieve Aughty each chief, 
each one likely for kingship used to flatter me: it was 
no presage of exaltation of spirit.


¶24] 
Never before did poet get such honor as mine upon 
the soft-swarded Hill of the Fair, from any king amongst 
the men of Ireland.


¶25] 
*Eochaidh* the Sage had not such honor from Hundred-fighting 
Conn as we from thee, thou ruling staff of Conn's 
*Banbha*.


¶26] 
Consider even *Fítheal*, the soothsayer of Cormac—
from thy long palm, thou chief of the slender-handed 
host of Bregia, I have had gifts such as *Fítheal* did not get.


¶27] 
In short—in the days of Niall or Corc of Cashel, 
*Torna*, teacher of the learned poets of the men of *Fál*, 
was not wont to obtain what I have obtained.


¶28] 
*Mac Coise*'s honor long ago, in the days of *Tadhg 
Mór* son of Cathal, is not comparable to mine; harder 
it is that thou shouldst perish from thy poet.


¶29] 
*Mac Liag*'s honor in *Leath Mogha*, in the time 
of Brian of *Bóromha*, though good was the king of *Fál*'s 
fair height, is not fit to set beside mine.


¶30] 
Never did the kings of Ireland give to the poets 
of hilly *Banbha* half as much as I got from thy dear 
countenance, or half my honor in a single house.




---

p.65


¶31] 
Since I cannot relate of thee sufficingly, Cathal 
O'Conor, it is grievous to me to speak of thee, alas that 
I did not perish by thy side.


¶32] 
None ever thought that I would remain after thee, 
it is shameful for me not to have gone with thee in 
requital for thy affection and thy bounty.


¶33] 
It is hard for the nobles of Innisfail, since I live and 
thou, O flower of the Gaels of *Connla*'s Plain, art no 
more, to have trust in any man of art.


¶34] 
Oft wouldst thou implore God for me that I should 
have a longer life than thine; O ruling hand of Bregia's
dewy plain, thy boon hath perturbed my mind.


¶35] 
Thy boon hath harmed us, alas; thou hast obtained 
from God, O gallant form, that we live after thee, thou 
only hope of *Muireadhach*'s rampart.


¶36] 
It was no wonder, O white-handed, modest-worded, 
that thou shouldst obtain thy desire, who never didst refuse 
any under heaven, O gracious, gentle face.


¶37] 
Thine own boon, the wrath of the Lord, hath
grieved me, thou bright and gallant form; in return for 
my loyalty to thee, through thee my devastation is come.

p.66


To *Mór*, daughter of Brian Ballach
-----------------------------------


¶1] 
Ah *Mór*, remember the affection, but in brief, thou 
eye with the hue of springing corn, there will be no 
difficulty in clearing away the charges which have 
sundered us.


¶2] 
In complaining to thee, thou soft of hair, I have—
what unkindness—to confess, though it is no secret, an 
unworthy deed.


¶3] 
Alas, I have committed against my trusty lord, thou 
fruit of the branches from Bregia's citadel, an action 
whereat his disposition changed.


¶4] 
To my lord at first, and also to those who entertained 
me, I gave reasons for displeasure, it was a portent of 
sorrow to do so.


¶5] 
In short—a numerous throng of mischief-makers 
asserted to him that I had done wrong to the noble, 
sweetly-speaking hero of Bregia.


¶6] 
People are saying to me that in a poem I addressed 
to O'Donnell I am said to have committed an unjustice 
against the stately race of *Conchobhar*.


¶7] 
Great forbearance did the lord of Sligo, lord of the 
host from that moated stead of Conn, show towards me 
at that time, considering all the mischief he heard of me.


¶8] 
From that time on I have been wandering from 
one territory to another to avoid him, through the fierce 
wrath of Conn's race, and because of Donnell's displeasure.




---

p.67


¶9] 
Although I have not been outlawed, O *Mór*, for 
enkindling his wrath, throughout the fair, splendid Plain of 
*Féilim* I am as good as exiled.


¶10] 
For a year's space, and a little more, I have not 
visited my homeland, as long as a hundred years it seems 
to me, I have been away in the wilds of Ireland.


¶11] 
Moreover, for a year my credit amongst the race 
of Nine-hostaged Niall and the seed of Conall has been 
failing, the weather turning against me.


¶12] The noble princes of the men of *Fál*, those from 
whom I used throughout my days receive the choicest 
favor—exhaust their entertainment of me in one day.


¶13] In my own place, while I am in disagreement with the 
lord of the Suck's noble plain, I have no enjoyment 
save that of an exiled man.


¶14] Unless God and thou can protect me, O wavy 
locks, there is no might that can rescue me; such 
misfortune has befallen me.


¶15] If thou deliver me in the time of my distress, thou 
bright and soft of form—this is a decree which all have 
confirmed, I shall be in thy possession for ever.


¶16] According to legal decree, O soft, slender, womanly 
hand, it is right if thou canst succour me that I should 
be thine in return for my protection.


¶17] Hast thou heard, thou apple-branch from *Fál*'s 
fair Dwelling, of the three birds of a strange and curious 
kind, which came to an emperor in Italy?


¶18] Every day they were ever in the presence of the 
high-king, over his head when coming in, and above the 
couch where he reclined.


¶19] For seven years these were with him day and 
night, the bird-flock did not on any day return without him.




---

p.68


¶20] Thus they were—trouble enough—without sleeping, 
without resting; not satisfying was the music of their 
discourse, wearying was their contention.


¶21] He offered his heritage, and also his daughter, to 
any man who knew the birds, and could tell what they 
were about.


¶22] 
Amongst the people there spake a youth, and 
vowed publicly forthwith, however hard it was for him, 
to rescue the king from his misery.


¶23] 
And thereupon he said: 'As for the business of 
the three birds with thee, whosoever may be ignorant 
thereof, it is not hidden from me.'


¶24] 
'These three birds, O emperor,' said the youth, 
'have a delicate matter to lay before thee, decide it justly.'


¶25] 
'These birds have for a long time had a case for 
judgment, and since justice is awaited from you it is high 
time for them that it should be instituted.'


¶26] 
'A woman-bird and two men are these three that 
are with thee, a matter that will cause them to be discussed 
forms a curious dispute between them.'


¶27] 'Relate to us, as thou art certain, O youth,' said 
the emperor, 'the tidings of each bird, their origin, and 
their adventures.'


¶28] 'Conceal not from me, tell me what has been the 
reason of their sojourn with me, now is the time to 
reveal it.'


¶29] 
'There came, O king,' said he, 'some time ago, a 
famine that lasted for a year, it afflicted the entire world 
throughout the globe.'


¶30] 
'The bird-flocks felt it, the salmon of the ocean, 
the herds of the land; curious was it when considered.'


¶31] 
'To one of the two birds belonged the woman-bird 
at first, throughout the famine he disowned her, when 
her protection was hardest.'




---

p.69


¶32] 
'From the other man-bird, during that dreadful 
year, she got everything of which she was in need, as 
he had her in that time of distress.'


¶33] 
'After they had come through that hard year, the 
former bird, he with whom she was in the beginning,
proceeded to take possession of her, wishing to claim 
her by right.'


¶34] 
'This is what the other man-bird says: that the 
woman is lawfully his, since it was he that brought her 
through that time so that she survived to the season of 
of *[sic]* prosperity.'


¶35] 
'These were the words just now, of the first bird, 
who rejected her in the hard year: whosoever be the 
woman's first mate she cannot deny him.'


¶36] 
'In order that you especially, rather than any 
other, might pronounce judgment for them, that is their 
object in remaining in thy presence, O king.'


¶37] 
As a judicial precedent the king adjudged that 
when she had come through the time of hardship, the 
bird should belong to him who had succoured her.


¶38] 
That verbal decree of the emperor has been under 
seal ever since, it is an award by which one must abide, 
it cannot be changed.


¶39] 
O daughter of Brian, thou sleek of hair, even thus 
wilt thou have custody of me after dispelling my hardship, 
in return for rescuing me from my misery.


¶40] 
Never can I forsake thy gentle countenance, I would 
not, moreover, if I could, thou tender and white of cheek, 
if thou protect me in the hour of my strait.


¶41] 
Make of me one of thine own, O lady of noble 
Niall's Castle, it is necessary for me and thee that I 
render thee allegiance in return.


¶42] Essay my protection, O benignant countenance, 
if it were difficult I could teach thee how to do it with 
thy thick, silky locks, and thy white hand.




---

p.70


¶43] 
Do not raise to him the gentle eye until Donnell 
and I be reconciled, neither spend nor husband his wealth, 
do not say that good is to be increased.


¶44] Neither heighten the renown of O'Conor of the 
plain of Tara, nor defend him from calumny; remain 
melancholy throughout the feast, remember no man in 
particular.


¶45] Enter not into securities for peace, do not pacify 
the neighbouring territories, O prudent mind, O bright 
of cheek, do not settle any suit or question.


¶46] 
Bathe not the hand or the bosom, or the pearly-hued 
teeth; approach not the host of Sligo for 
feasting or music.


¶47] 
Maintain not any rule or law, hinder not the quarrels 
of thy assemblies—until peace is obtained for thy poet 
from the wrath of *Conchobhar*'s race.


¶48] 
Many a thing dost thou do—if thou art attempting 
to protect me, thou rosy lady of Bregia's Hill, which 
is more difficult for thee.


¶49] Much harder is it for thee to bend the oak-trees 
by thy counsel—subdue, even as thou dost the 
fruitful wood, the displeasure of the head of *Conchobhar*'s race.


¶50] Calm the wrath of the high-king of the Duff, as 
thou calmest the anger of the wave, soften the fury of 
the man's storm even as the winter wind is silenced by thee.


¶51] 
As the melodious babbling streams are deprived 
by thee of their eloquence, easier is it to control the lord 
of Carbury in anything in which thou attemptest to instruct him.


¶52] 
Even as thou curbest the forays of all others, let 
some bridle be laid by thy ruddy, gently-speaking, 
stately figure on the vengeful wrath of Donnell.




---

p.71


¶53] 
As thou makest shallow the streams, so that they 
bear not the salmon, thus were it easy to abate the anger 
of this descendant of *Fiachaidh*.


¶54] As thou causest the waves of the sea to ebb, and 
abatest the bitter, cold, tempestuous weather, even so 
make to ebb all the wrath which threatens thy poet, 
that is the sum of what I have sung.


¶55] 
If thou, O *Mór*, join with *Meadhbh* while our dispute 
lasts, there is nothing that can oppose me, despite all the 
ill-feeling there is against me.

p.72


Brian na Murratha
-----------------


¶1] Towards the warlike man peace is observed, that
is a proverb which cannot be outdone; throughout the 
fair forests of *Banbha* none save the fighting man finds
peace.


¶2] If any one amongst the warriors of Bregia deem
it well to pacify the Saxons, this will suffice for his
protection, so it is said, let him spend a while in
continually spoiling them.


¶3] The Gaels of civil behaviour will not get peace from
the foreigners, such is the their warfare, these most valorous,
royal hosts, that it is not worth a treaty of peace.


¶4] No object for pacification are the seed of Conall,
or the seed of *Eóghan* of the standards, or yet *Cathaoir*'s
desendants, or the seeds of *Sadbh*, or the valiant race
of *Conchobhar*.


¶5] The nobility of the blood of fair *Gaedhel* is 
vanished almost to a man; such hopeful quarry are they
that pursuit of them is nothing to boast of.


¶6] They are being thrust on to the outskirts of *Banbha*,
whilst regiments of foreigners are in the centre; of the seed
of Eber and Eremon a one-sided [*...*]*(?)* hath been made.


¶7] It is but fitting that the Saxon soldiery fulfil not
terms of peace with the scattered band; it seems to 
them—alas that is should be so—that the hosts of *Banbha*
are without a warranty.


¶8] It is because of their weakness in fighting men
against the foriegn battalions that beyond those of any
land in Europe ths wounded and unfairly—used people
lack peace.




---

p.73


¶9] Lack of counsel it is that has rendered the people
subservient to the wrathful, tyrannical band; alas that
they do not find those who would exhort them through 
any single man of valour!


¶10] Great unfriendliness were it did none of the poets
of the bright-knolled land say to the men of *Fódla* that 
they should declare war upon the foreigners.


¶11] Since our darling amongst the race of *Míl* is the
son of Brian, lavisher of herds, with gentle utterances I 
shall counsel the scion of Limerick's vigourous, nimble
host.


¶12] I would give counsel of a friend to the head
of royal *Fearghna*'s line, that he, ripe fruit of the vine,
kindle a tiny spark in the embers.


¶13] I will moreover, with brief discourse—what is it
but a kindling of righteous wrath?—give to the king of 
rivered *Magh Sléacht* an incitment to foray.


¶14] Easy it is for him to give battle, from the sympathy 
of five noble nations, from one coast to the other
Ireland will join him in a united war.


¶15] Throughout fertile *Banbha*'s plain, the rest, both 
kings and princes, will kindle sympathy with him, even
as one house takes fire from another.


¶16] When the men of Ireland learn that the high-king
of *Aolmhagh* is making war, throughout *Banbha* of the 
glistening showers there will not be a land without one
to despoil it.


¶17] Eager for mischief are the men of Ireland, they
will rise with him in their full strength; the Gaels will
strive to unite so that Ireland may depend on a single
surety.


¶18] Only by keen war for our plain of *Úna* can he
wage them, his will be the profit or the blame there
of—these forays on *Úghaine*'s isle.




---

p.74


¶19] Let stone castles become couches for wild beasts,
let grass so hide each road that he leave the bright
surfaced plain of Tara over-run with wild deer and 
wolves.


¶20] Let them leave such famine in the valley of the 
Boyne, and by the long-branched shores of Birr, that the 
woman in Meath's rich plain eat of the heart of her firstborn.


¶21] Let the white-limbed hero of *Gáirighe* effect that
there shall be nothing of their precious treasures, or at
all events of their limewashed castles, save the saying 
that once upon a time they were.


¶22] Let their fruitful orchard be cut down, let their
corn-crops be shorn by the defenders of Croghan's
province, spirited, ruddy-bladed warriors.


¶23] Beside Teltown let great towers be pulverised
by him, let him sweep utterly away their mills, their
kilns, their granaries.


¶24] 
Throughout Ushnagh let the level borders of 
spreading plains become moorlands, so that the man
beside *Teathbha* may not find a trace of the four roads.


¶25] Let it be treasured up for the passing guest as a 
marvellous thing if the lowing of a single cow be heard
around Colt, or by green-swarded Usnagh.


¶26] From Naas of Leinster let powerful men carry
away heavy burdens of massive *(?)* ancient gilt goblets
and of the sides of their merchant's coffers.


¶27] Let, moreover, poor and friendless men become 
wealthy, and let wealthy and powerful noblemen be made
poor.


¶28] After the deeds the seed of *Ruarc* slow to anger 
shall perform the foreigner's of *Almha*'s fertile meadow
will ask for a treaty of peace.


¶29] Messengers will come from them to seek a truce
from the warriors of *Banbha*'s land; they will ply the
graceful, affable folk with sweet, honorable speeches.




---

p.75


¶30] Their robs of satin, their precious treasures, they
will bring to the host of ancient Sligo, whose nobles will
be plied with golden rings by the surly, impatient band.


¶31] They will ask the leader of peace of bright
Ushnagh's meadow to come with them to court, and 
they will not yet seek requital for what the seed of 
*Fearghna* will have done on that raid.


¶32] Let them not with honeyed words beguile Brian 
son of Brian from Breffney, woe to him who would
approach them, ravenous, destructive barbarians.


¶33] Does he know of the case of the lion, once when
he attempted treachery? To no one yet born does he
show gratitude*(?)*, this king of all the animals.


¶34] He summoned to him the quadrupeds of the earth,
they go at the first asking; many a proud, headstrong
band attended the thronged gathering.


¶35] The chief of the fox tribe came not at the beginning
of the party, but kept away for the time, until he found
a suitable opportunity.


¶36] On the same path then the foxes go to him 
together—it was not meet to contend with them in their
crafts—a wily, stealthy pack.


¶37] When the host, not numerous enough for battle,
had gone to look at the lion's cave, they filled with fear
for their lives, a weak and spiritless hosting.


¶38] The first fox who approached the lime-white entrance
of the gorgeous cavern bid those on the outer threshold
return with one accord.


¶39] 'Clearly can I see coming up to this track of 
every quadruped, but there is no track leaving it, ye
modest, youthful, prudent band.'


¶40] 'Did we go into that fortress', said the leader of 
the guileful company, 'never would our returning tracks
from the smooth, artful rampart be found'.

¶41] Those foxes, then, turned away from the greedy
cave, in brief, what they said is conceived by us to apply
to the white-breasted swan of the Finn.


¶42] This court of the foreign battalions is the cave of
the nimble lion, and the hosts of the Irish territory are
the slain quadrupeds.


¶43] Let Brian, son of Brian, son of Owen, understand
that none of the bright *Banbha*'s warriors come from the
foreigners safe from treachery or betrayal.


¶44] With such terror has the uniting thread of this 
land of *Lugh* inspired the Saxons that even if the rest
surrendered him into their custody it would not be easy
to capture him.


¶45] It is in his power, the chief of royal *Fearghna*'s
race, to defend Tara; the rest cannot but guard him,
blossom of the vine tendrils.


¶46] The nobles Ba*Banbha* could not rescue generous
Brian, son of Brian, yet it were not difficult for the 
well-followed hero of the Duff to succour all the Gaels.


¶47] The hatred of the foreigners for him is his testimony *(?)*;
all have been proclaiming for long that she is
his—he holds *Fódla* by the bridle.


¶48] It is easy for him to defend her against them,
many are his allies, far and wide lie his forces, while he
has naught to protect save Ireland.


¶49] The races from which his mother came will be
around the son of Brian in phalanxes*(?)*; each tribe like
a precipitous flood *(?)*, the seed of Niall *Caille* and the 
race of Conall.


¶50] The three *Luighne* will be around the chief of 
Breffney, a broad-shielded, numerous throng; the men of 
Tireragh, the men of Carbury, the men of Corran, will 
be with him in the fighting without delay.

p.77


¶51] The three MacSweeneys from the march of *Bearnas*
will also join him in one band; come weal come woe let
them not part from him, steel of the bright host of the 
Gael.


¶52] The Hy Many will join the son of *Gráinne*, with 
crimson, blue-headed javelins—they will leave the foreign
women wet-cheeked—and the haughty line of *Fearghus*.


¶53] From the Inny to Loch Erne all are with him,
both freemen and wanderers, and from Boyle to stormy
Loch Oughter, the men of Fermanagh, the O'Rourkes,
the O'Reillys.


¶54] The three chieftains of Connacht will go with him
in a bannered mass, three stately, mighty regiments, the 
valiant line of *Conchobhar*.


¶55] The *Clann Domhnaill* will be with him in their 
full strength, like oaks towering above the groves, a gay
and wondrous band of the soldiery of *Fódla*, the mercenaries
of Islay.


¶56] The lords of the Gail will then march to Dublin
at the outset, many a stone castle will be laid in ruins
by the stubborn, headstrong fighters.


¶57] From the generous seed of *Ruarc* the valley of 
the Boyne will be a mass of lightning, the foreign tribes
from *Cliú* to Croghan [*...*][9](javascript:footNote('T402563/note009.html')).


¶58] The fierce, heroic swarm will have many an ornamented
goblet and basin, many sledges for shattering
walls, many vats and shining cans.


¶59] Many a spit and hook will they have, and many
heavy corded bundles, many tables and pots, and plenty
of other booty.

p.78


¶60] The slopes of Meath will be covered by them with
the vastness of the spoils from the cities, the powerful,
cunning host will make many a road about the bright-trouted
Boyne.


¶61] At sleeping time, after spoiling *Magh Ceóil*, the 
children of kings will have in their camps plenty of 
half-cooked flesh for griddles.


¶62] The foreigners about Ushnagh's field will then say
to the people of fair Boyle that they will not allow the 
blood of *Cairbre* to take their kine, their spoils and their
manifold wealth.


¶63] The nobles of the Gael will not respect the utterance 
of the fair, splendid warriors, the children of 
*Cobhthach* will marvel greatly that the foreigners should
contend with them.


¶64] Then will the Saxon battalions and the hosts of 
royal Tara take the field of battle, many deaths will the 
wondrous, fortunate host wreak upon them.


¶65] Then will they hack at one another till even; many
foreigners, many Gaels will perish by the numerous,
irrestible host.


¶66] Many a keen, razor-edged arrow from the bow
will pierce the flesh of a nobleman; many a cold blade
and javelin, and slender, shining battle-axe.


¶67] The land of Meath will be flooded with ruddy pools 
from the two vigorous bands, until blood rises above the
shoulders on that bright-surfaced plain of Tara.


¶68] Then will the Saxon tribe be vanquished by the 
seed of keen-weaponed *Gaedheal*, so that from the 
proclamation of war there will never be any save Irishmen
over the land of *Fódla*.


¶69] On the night following the battle on the hill above
the beguiling streams of the Boyne there will be many
a noble, comely body in death-throes*(?)* from the hero of 
the Maigue's fertile valley.




---

p.79


¶70] There will be many a scaldcrow tearing the flesh
of stout-weaponed warriors, and many will be the ravens
and wolves around bright, fertile, salmon-abounding *Cliú*.


¶71] On the slopes of Meath many will be the wet-eyed
queens over their dead, from *(the deeds of)* the host of 
the Erne many will be the keen, ardent cries over them.

¶1] The land of *Banbha*is but swordland: let all be 
defied to show that there is any inheritance to the Land of 
*Fál* save that of conquest by force of battle!


¶2] 
No one man has any lawful claim to the shining 
land of the ancient Gaels. The law of this territory is 
that it shall be subjugate to him who is strongest.


¶3] 
The father does not bequeath to the son *Fódla*'s 
Isle of noble scions; until it be obtained by force it 
cannot be occupied.


¶4] 
Neither the Sons of *Míl* of Spain nor any who have 
conquered her have any claim to the land of *Fál* save 
that of taking her by force.


¶5] 
The spreading-branchéd forests of *Fál*'s Plain 
were taken forcibly from the guileful race of *Nemhedh*—
most courtly line.


¶6] 
By force, moreover, such their tale, were the 
wondrous hills of Ireland—the best dispellers of sorrow—
captured from the *Fir Bolg*.


¶7] By force, again, was the land won from the kings 
of the *Tuatha Dé Danann*, when the noble Children of 
*Míl* wrested from them the dewy plain of Bregia.


¶8] Forcibly was the Land of *Fál* taken from the Sons 
of Spanish *Míl*; the Hill of The Three Men is not wont 
to be obtained save by force.


¶9] Although the Gaels conquered the spacious, kindly 
land, it was reconquered in despite of them, and has passed 
into the power of foreigners.

¶10] 
There come across the sea in three battalions the 
warriors of France, the soldiery of Greece and the mercenaries 
of the eastern land, the wondrous youth of England.


¶11] 
The Greeks of swift steeds, the men of England, 
the nobles of France—bright, wonderful warriors—divide 
Ireland in three parts.


¶12] 
The men from fair Greece and the foreigners from 
bright, fierce England wrest from the war-seasoned race of 
Eber the share of *Mugh Néid*'s son.


¶13] The warriors of the seed of Charles conquer from Limerick 
to Lecale, Conn the Hundredfighter's share of 
the ancient, green-isled land.


¶14] 
The descendants of Charles conquered from Cashel 
to the Ards, from ancient Tory yonder to the flock-strewn 
*Caol* of Aran.


¶15] 
Where is there, from the Boyne to Limerick of the 
ships, a single quarter of land from which they derive 
not a certain portion?


¶16] 
I forbear for a space, from fear of reproach, to 
recount their tributes, until their defender come.


¶17] Should any say that the Burkes of lion-like prowess 
are strangers—let one of the blood of Gael or Gall be 
found who is not a sojourner amongst us.


¶18] 
Should any say they deserve not to receive their 
share of Ireland—who in the sweet, dew-glistening field 
are more than visitors to the land ?


¶19] 
Though the descendants of *Gaedheal Glas* used 
speak of the race of Charles, set stones of *Banbha*'s hills, 
as foreigners—foreigners were they who spoke thus.


¶20] 
Ireland cannot escape from them, for four centuries 
and ten years has the warm, ancient, humid land been 
under the fair warriors of the seed of Charles.

¶21] 
It is they who are the noblest in blood, it is they 
who have best won the heritage; from them—nobles to 
whom homage is meet—the Bregian Boyne can hardly be wrested.


¶22] There will not be, nor has there ever been a line 
equal in power to the race that sprang from William, 
rulers of the Dwelling of Tara.


¶23] 
As far east as the stream of Jordan there is no 
field that was not conquered by them; if the fair Plain 
of *Flann* should be overcome we need not wonder.


¶24] 
Of them was he who conquered London from the 
Saxons, although they were watching for him in a bitter, 
furious mass.


¶25] 
Of them was he who took Jerusalem by force—
many things are related thereof—the centre of the 
fourfold world.


¶26] 
Twenty-one battles, moreover, as I know, they 
waged over Ireland, wresting the bright centre of the 
Gaels from the seed of Eremon of Bregia.


¶27] 
By Richard the Great was gained the Battle of 
the Cinders, the battle of *Calgach*, the famous conflict 
of Trim, the fray of the castle by Frewen.


¶28] 
Richard, moreover, gave in one month three battles 
to the blood of noble Conall and the race of Niall, stems 
from a single cluster.


¶29] 
The same man it is that fought the battles of *Loch 
Cuain* and of *Beannchor*, and—long has the result of the 
conflict been a benefit—the battle of *Annla* against the 
Ulstermen.


¶30] 
At *Ros Guill* by northern Tory, moreover, he gave 
battle to *Ó Maol Doraidh* and overthrew the race of 
Conall, it was a conflict of strength.


¶31] 
It is that Richard who divided *Leath Cuinn* with 
boundary ditches and into smooth acres yonder at his 
dwelling including Connachtmen and Ulstermen.

p.83


¶32] 
Under the favored offspring Sir Richard, him of 
the fair-browed, generous countenance, not a fastness or 
a hunting mound of victorious *Leath Cuinn* was left un tilled.


¶33] 
From the Strand of *Baile*, son of *Buan*, to the 
shores of the Suir in its pleasant valley was his; his from 
the blue, sunny-banked Suir to the western Head of Erris.


¶34] 
He was lord over Shannon and Suir, over the 
murmuring waters of Cong, over the Moy, the babbling 
streams of the Bann, and all the rivers between them.


¶35] 
Salmon from Assaroe, from the pleasant shore of 
the Bann, and from Cashel's slender stream, used to be 
served on the same spit to that earl.


¶36] On one dish of ruddy gold the nuts of *Seaghais*, 
fragrant fruit of Derry, and apples from the banks of the 
*Bóroimhe*, would be served to Sir Richard.


¶37] 
Never was there found the equal of his kinsman, 
Sir William, he continued the triumphs of the man, like 
to his father in disposition.


¶38] Eight battles are reckoned to William *Óg*, high-king 
of the Burkes, gained over the Leinstermen, over *Leath 
Cuinn*, by the imperious hero of *Umhall*.


¶39] 
The battles of Liffey, of *Magh Máil* against Leinster, 
unkindly enough! The battle of Loch Neagh in Ulster, 
and four battles against Connacht.


¶40] 
The famous battle of Slievemurry, the battle of 
Inny, in the Annaly, the celebrated battle of Athenry, 
gained by the valor of the highking *(or were amongst 
the exploits of the highking)*.


¶41] 
As for Scottish Edmund, none dared to oppose him ; 
not so much opposition did he find as an attempt to speak 
disobediently.


¶42] 
Thomas, son of Edmund, was, in short, of the same 
bearing, and his valorous son Edmund, blue-eyed, smooth 
handed warrior.

p.84


¶43] 
Richard, son of another Edmund—no likely opponent 
was the fiery dragon—the fruit of the orchard from 
London did not receive homage from the blood of Conn.


¶44] There was no lair of the wild deer, in dangerous 
passes, or on the slopes of valleys, in Richard's day, 
that he did not despoil, so that he disquieted the isle of 
Ireland.


¶45] Richard—great was the power—a man by whom 
Conn's Tara was laid low, gave the spoils of Meath, the 
tribute of Kells, as wages to the men of *Umhall*.


¶46] 
In those days, of which ye have heard, the star 
of the Plain of the Champions brought the gates of Bregian 
Tara to Loch Mask on *Magh Tuireadh*.


¶47] 
The caldron of the king of Man across the sea, the 
smooth-framed harp of *Beann Éadair*, were brought to 
his house by the hero*(?)* of Tara, together with the chess 
from *Eamhain* in Ulster.


¶48] 
Long did great John, son of Richard, follow in his 
path, harassing the men of Ireland for possession of the 
bright, fresh-swarded Dwelling of the Fair.


¶49] 
Oliver, son of John, got John's heritage of the land of 
*Fál*; of those that took the grassy Field of *Fionntan*, 
no man's son excelled him.


¶50] 
John Burke, son of Oliver, is the man that will 
spend and defend the ruddy-nutted plains of the blood 
of Cas, and the boundaries of the shore of *Bearnas*.


¶51] 
The blossom of the apple-tree from *Eamhain* 
surpasses all his forbears, from Oliver back to William; 
to each man is his destiny apportioned.


¶52] 
An unfathomable ocean bed, a heart not to be 
doubted, a steed from the swift brood of *Eamhain*'s
rampart, a pious, subtle mind.


¶53] 
A brimming well in sultry days, a magnifier of 
every good, a resolve no less firm than are planted rocks, 
tokens of an adventurous prince.

¶54] 
The object of his enemies' blessings, instructor of 
the lords, expected mate for the plain of Meath, herdsman 
of his enemies' cattle.


¶55] 
Battle-stay of the land of Bregia, gate of death 
to the race of *Míl*; smooth-fingered hand most unyielding 
in battle, most precious treasure of the Burkes.


¶56] 
Mac William Burke, enemy of evil, capable to 
banish unseemly customs; strong is his hand against their 
wickedness, a prince like royal Caesar of the Romans.


¶57] 
There is no son of Gael or Englishman, from the 
Ards in Ulster to Achill, that is not full of the same 
affection for him concerning the possession of *Úghaine's* 
fair-swarded Plain.


¶58] 
John, grandson of John, has no enemy or friend who 
has any reason to doubt his claim to *Cobhthach's*
bright-walled castle.


¶59] 
From childhood's days until now, I defy each 
learned man to show that the scion of Bregia's citadel 
committed any deed of which his heart might repent.


¶60] 
In earnest or in play, in assurance or timidity the 
star of Sligo's host never meditated anything which would 
need confession afterwards.


¶61] 
The mischief-maker *(even)* is witness that he never 
said, nor was there ever said of him—bright cheek like 
the berry—anything he would conceal in a whisper.


¶62] 
Never was there said of his radiant face anything 
which would be fitting to hide from him, and he never 
concealed from anyone the reason of his foe's conspiracy.


¶63] 
Should it happen that a man were able to slay 
those who surrounded him, once he submit to him he 
need not fear vengeance.


¶64] 
Steeds have not been shod, nor has blade or corslet 
been hasped since he, gentle grey eye, from which the 
sea is calm, gained lordship.

¶65] 
There is no going into camp in his days, no weapon 
stirred from its rack; no one under heaven in dread, no 
rumours of ravaging parties to be heard.


¶66] 
No asking for tidings, no expeditions or hostings, 
no spoiling, no destruction, no conflict, no plundering of 
anything from an enemy.


¶67] 
Nothing which might make a woman tremble, no 
Gael committing injustice against any Englishman, nor 
any Englishman despoiling a Gael, no wrong of any 
man permitted.


¶68] 
From the prosperity of the peaceful kingship there 
is entrancing fairy music in the speech of each man to 
his fellow, around the defender of Curlews' plain.


¶69] 
Conn O'Donell—may God protect him! Precious 
scion of the race of the highkings; a man without lack 
of courage in exploits, leader of the warriors from Lifford.

Four score, five hundred and one thousand since

EDMUND BURKE
------------


¶1] What now delays Edmund? Surely we shall not 
endure to be as we have been for some time, like any 
captive at the mercy of the foreigners.


¶2] Everyone has noticed the length of this delay of 
Edmund's, ere the man's pride was enkindled, ere he 
found a reason for rebellion.


¶3] 
I know not what has hitherto kept the prince of 
the soil of *Umhall* like a hostage in English fetters, under 
the treacherous enactments of the foreigners.


¶4] 
Not weariness of battle nor peril of conflict, not lack 
of army or following has ever restrained the hero of 
*Bóroimhe* from setting forth.


¶5] 
Not [*...*]*(?)* days are responsible for *(the delay of)* the 
active, courageous one, hand by which the Fold of the 
Fair is overthrown, neither is it [*...*] *(?)* or bad weather.


¶6] 
When the man would be setting forth the prophecies of 
soothsayers or poets would not hinder his graceful 
form from spoiling or sacking Ireland.


¶7] 
Both to me and to himself has been known for 
some time past the sole reason for the delay of Edmund, 
chief of the people of Conn's spreading plain.


¶8] 
The amount of his riches and his wealth, the regality 
of his great princedom—these were protecting 
Ireland, warm bright-stoned Plain of the Three Fair Ones.


¶9] 
Edmund himself did not perceive—this certainly is 
the reason for the delay of his ruddy countenance—that 
there was a single thing lacking to him.

p.88


¶10] 
So long as he were permitted to be without trouble 
or hardship Ireland would be as a level pool from edge 
to edge.


¶11] 
As soon as he is attacked the English and the 
Gaels of Ireland will teem with treachery towards one 
another, with anger and discontent.


¶12] 
That which was never endured before let not the 
son of MacWilliam endure it; since there is a case for 
battle it is no day for Edmund to make peace.


¶13] 
Since conflict is kindling let him not leave it in 
doubt [10](javascript:footNote('T402563/note010.html')) but the hero of Bregia will requite their unjust 
deed.


¶14] 
The fight has been forced upon him without the 
leave of the dark-lashed youth, the more likely is he, 
pillar of battle of Corc's Plain, to avenge the matter.


¶15] 
Ever since days of old [*...*] the man [*...*] the man 
that begins the quarrel.[11](javascript:footNote('T402563/note011.html'))


¶16] 
What war has there ever been in which he that 
first started it was not vanquished? That is the way 
in wars.


¶17] Have we not witness enough in the assembly of 
Pompey, the hosting of Caesar? The descendant of the 
chieftain from the Plain of *Cnodhbha* is as in the case 
of the Civil War.


¶18] 
Pompey, if it be true, first made war against 
Caesar, and though victorious for a while, he was 
remorseful in the end.


¶19] 
Caesar, in fine, vanquished Pompey who first caused 
the conflict, and the valiant hosts from the eastern land, 
as they had begun the war.


¶20] 
Those who enkindle dissension are ever defeated 
in requital for making war, a work that does not meetly 
go unpunished.

¶21] 
Badly did it result for the Trojan warriors to make 
the first day's war; they provoked the Grecian heroes, 
who considered not an occasion of battle.


¶22] 
The people of Troy did not suppose at first that 
in that fierce, ardent conflict—it was not long till they 
felt the result of their wrong doing—the armies of the 
world would rout them.


¶23] 
[*...*] the mighty Grecian soldiery, of admirable 
deeds, a lasting example fit to be cherished.

Those that started the war—the Greeks did not

their native place.


¶25] 
Just such a war as that did Eber unjustly proclaim 
upon Eremon son of *Míl* about the green-pathed plain of 
the champion of *Fál*.


¶26] The end of their battling was that Eber fell by 
Eremon in his impetuous anger *(fighting)* for the bright 
centre of the sunset land.


¶27] 
Great *Mugh Nuadhad* and *Mugh Néeid*, well did 
they expiate such an act—first renouncing peace with 
Conn, a deed they could not maintain.


¶28] 
Conn beheaded both *Mugh Néeid* and venomous 
*Mugh Nuadhad*, ill did it result for the progeny of the 
chief of *Fál* that they did not uphold the law of battle.


¶29] 
May a like destruction, since it is he that is attacked, 
be told of Edmund; a sure result of all unjust dealings 
in war.


¶30] 
He hath been treacherously dealt with; against 
him the war hath been begun [*...*] [12](javascript:footNote('T402563/note012.html'))

¶32] 
So long as they held from the son of MacWilliam 
the fertile portion of Connacht they would not need to 
pursue him to plunder the dangerous mountain ravines and morasses.


¶33] 
For the arrogant, stubborn band it would be putting 
the head into a lion's den to plunder the man of his 
ancestral land, or it were to approach a blazing house.


¶34] Or it would be plunging the bare hand into the 
griffin's nest in order to destroy her first brood, to meddle 
with his bright, softly-speaking countenance, or it would 
be plundering laden{?) bees.


¶35] 
Or it would be waging battle in spite of terms, 
or snatching treasure from fairy palaces or—woe to 
him that must face her—teasing a hound through her 
puppies.


¶36] Or it is handling the edges of naked weapons, or 
arousing a red bear, for the warmly-housed *(?)* soldiery 
from beyond the wave to attempt combat with Edmund.


¶37] Or does anyone suppose that when Edmund had 
been plundered he would leave anything of value in 
[*...*] smooth, beautiful land of [*...*]. . castles?


¶38] If any indeed so thought they had no justification; 
an evil not easy to repress is the surging of rapine from

¶1] 
Well mayst thou use this weapon, Edmund, O bright, 
pearl-gray eye; may it be an omen of danger to the 
enemies of thy fair-cheeked, lime-bright countenance.


¶2] 
May this weapon which is bestowed on thee, thou 
youth to whom such as we are dear, be a sign of 
protection of friends, despoiling of foes.


¶3] 
May it portend the exaltation of thy kindred, may 
it render time and occasion propitious, thou strong hand 
in quelling hosts—may it be a sign of the debasement 
of foreigners.


¶4] 
This weapon of mine is not as the weapons of others, 
though one would be glad to obtain it, dangerous are 
the conditions which go with it, thou smooth-footed 
warrior of *Bearnas*.


¶5] 
Thou shouldst not—if thou wouldst do so—take 
a weapon thoughtlessly from my hand in return for gold 
and silver, thou war-sprite of *Gabhrán*'s bright Plain.


¶6] 
It will not suffer thy broad face to be unwatchful, 
unprepared, or that thy splendid form heed not to be 
active and alert.


¶7] 
It likes not that its companions sleep where they 
eat their breakfast, it endures not a refusal of battle, 
hard it is to accept its prohibitions.


¶8] 
Be the host few or many, be there peace or disturbance, 
this keen-edged sword which no blade rivals 
desires not to be even for one night on the rack.


¶9] 
Desisting from foray is one of its prohibitions, and 
this weapon thou hast received, thou hero from Art's 
lime-washed Dwelling, may not take one step in retreat.

¶10] 
Didst thou take a prey with it even on the seventh 
day it were no harm; it is not possible for this weapon 
to abide for the time of a month without spoil, without 
trophies.


¶11] Were I thy suitor thou wouldst wreak, O bright 
face, in search of the treasure of Conn's bounded Field 
a hundred other injuries.


¶12] 
Thou wouldst not slumber on down or on quilt, 
wert thou answerable to me thou wouldst not dare 
consume a feast without a sentry keeping watch for thee.


¶13] 
Thou wouldst be one day beside the Duff, beside 
the sunny slopes of Aughty, another by Croghan of the 
battalions, and another at the borders of Tara's Dwelling.


¶14] 
Thou wouldst make conflagrations about Loughrea, 
thou wouldst spend a day in spoiling thy gilt bucklers *(?)* 
beside Bregia's plain, O bright form, or at ancient Loch
Key, having made a foray on it.


¶15] 
If Walter, thou slender of hand, be feasting or 
playing chess, be thou in arms to win triumphs, until 
his men of means *(?)* are despoiled.


¶16] 
The function of [*...*]*(?)* with ships, the function of the 
tongs in the smithy, O fruitful branch of *Íor*'s Dwelling, 
is thine for thy high-king.


¶17] 
Unless thou do as I have said to thee thou wilt 
get from this weapon as regards the treasure and the 
booty of Conn's race naught but failure or death, O Edmund.


¶18] 
Their crimson mantles, their graceful hounds, their 
women, their rings, their chessmen, their golden drinking-horns 
are freely thine, their gifts of gold and silver.


¶19] 
If thou desire, thou warrior of *Codhal*, to be long-lived 
and prosperous, let the conditions of this weapon 
be maintained, never be they violated.

MAC WILLIAM BURKE
-----------------


¶1] 
Much circumspection is due to the title of king, 
it must be guarded both from headstrong arrogance and 
lack of vigor, it is truly difficult to defend it.


¶2] 
If a man be headstrong he must needs be given to 
forays and wars, he will draw upon himself a contest for 
the kingship, and his land will be wrested from him.


¶3] 
Howbeit, let not one choose to be humble and 
servile; he will be despised thereby, not kingly is he 
who resolves thus.


¶4] 
Between arrogance and gentleness lies the golden 
mean of kingship; the king who is most moderate in his 
bearing is able to deal with disobedience.


¶5] 
According to this not many of us are fitted to 
assume kingship; it is not easy for a man to undertake 
it, considering these qualities which pertain to it.


¶6] 
Saving this only, might not Richard, son of Oliver—
smooth hand like the blossom of the thorn—boast now 
that all follow his standard ?


¶7] 
He seeks naught from anyone else, and he leaves 
none unsatisfied (?}; despite the amount he spends of 
his wealth, there comes no ebbtide in his riches.


¶8] 
Although he has attained to kingship after winning 
every territory, it is enough for him to be as before, 
Richard, son of Mac William.


¶9] 
According to the judgment of the learned of Innisfail 
on Richard, grandson of John, he is the best, since he 
is the eldest, if he can answer for his comrades.

p.94


¶10] 
It is hard for them to displease the son of the queen 
from *Ráth Murbhaigh*; he of his race has the best 
claim, such might will be joined with him.


¶11] 
He is the most temperate in spirit, and has the 
best talents for lordship; the long of the Moy, chief in 
every fortune—by him is it most efficiently defended.


¶12] 
Never a day has the king of Cong been found 
humble or submissive—although he has plenty of prudence—
hand which would not be checked in combat.


¶13] 
Neither is there any danger to the champion of 
Achill, high-spirited though he be, of being plundered 
on account of his arrogant spirit, fruitful branch of a lord.


¶14] 
Just such a warrior as he obtained the reward of 
his temperate spirit, the heir of the king of the Greeks, 
a deed most likely to be remembered.


¶15] 
The name of the youth was great Daedalus, son 
of Saturn, best warrior of the Greeks in valor, a 
graceful-fingered, kindly scion.


¶16] 
He coaxed—what greater affection?—the daughter 
of the emperor of the world to elope with him from sea 
to sea, without asking the leave of her father.


¶17] 
Along with him on his excursion, Daedalus, apple-branch
surpassing the forest, brought his two brothers 
to guard the life of the warrior.


¶18] 
After exploring the lands they are wafted to a 
lonely isle, inhabited by no one in the world.


¶19] When this company of four had spent some time 
there, the maiden went of her own will to the green 
shore of the isle.


¶20] 
After a space a warrior of wondrous array came 
towards her; the woman, alone by the shore, regarded 
him for a while.


¶21] 
Never was there fashioned, of all human creatures, 
clay more beautiful than that warrior, face *(radiant)* as 
the moon, throat *(white)* as a blossom.




---

p.95


¶22] 
The young and. gift worthy warrior saluted the 
modest maiden, such fear was in her heart that she made 
him no reply.


¶23] 
And then he asked: 'What land is this in which 
thou art, or who has a right to dwell in it, thou 
graceful-handed, chaste beauty?'


¶24] 
'The children of the king of Greece, who never
grudged wealth, Daedalus and his two brothers, they,' 
said she, 'are in possession of the land, three appletrees 
from a single stem.'


¶25] 
'I shall bear thee away from the three heroes, 
maiden,' said the warrior; 'sorrowful are thy words,' 
said the woman, 'it would be an omen of conflict were 
they heard.'


¶26] 
'Didst thou so deal with me,' said she, 'in despite 
of my husband, it would be difficult for all the world to 
shelter thee, from the terror of the high-king's weapon.'


¶27] 
'I shall take their ship with me, and the three 
chieftains who are within shall remain in weakness of 
travail in this land until the end of the world.'


¶28] 
He carried the woman into the ship, and then 
departed from the isle, having outwitted Daedalus, the 
generous, whitetoothed hero.


¶29] 
She cried as she left the shore, he rushed to her 
at once to see what was her trouble, or why she grieved.


¶30] He sees a ship under full sail, just visible from
the strange land, speeding out to sea; he hears a cry 
from the vessel.


¶31] 
For seven days after, as it is told, Daedalus and 
the company who were ashore remained without woman, 
without ship.




---

p.96


¶32] 
'O brothers, it is poor-spirited of us,' said bright-faced 
Daedalus, 'not to escape with the wings of birds, 
and fly from the isle across the sea.'


¶33] 
With strong glue they attach a bird's wing 
to the shoulder of each man; they arise from the slopes of the 
hills across the deep expanse of the ocean.


¶34] 
In arrogance of spirit the youngest of the eager 
heroes arises; from the sea he goes close to the sun, 
and ascended into the high heavens.


¶35] 
The sun's heat dissolved the fair glue, the wings 
gave way; he fell helpless headlong into the deep billows 
of the ocean.


¶36] 
The second youth kept close by the surface of 
the great streams, so that his stout pinion was struck 
from him by the cold flight of the water.


¶37] 
Upon the severing of the heavy wings by the 
harsh edges of the green waves the second warrior 
meets his death; an occasion of grief.


¶38] 
The elder of the joyous, fair youths, in a course 
between loftiness and lowliness, went unharmed across 
the surface of the white-foamed sea.


¶39] 
On coming to land the high-king seized his sword 
and his bright lance, and followed in the track of the 
couple.


¶40] He searched the whole world in pursuit of the 
pair and when he overtook them afterwards he caused
their bodies to be hacked in pieces.


¶41] 
He slew the ruddy, white-toothed woman and her 
paramour; he gave him due cause of remorse for seeking 
his wife from him.


¶42] 
The young maiden is the wand of kingship, yours 
was that woman at first; be not slumbering, thou bright 
of cheek, the maiden has been stolen from thee.




---

p.97


¶43] 
The ship, moreover, O soft of hair, answers to 
those places of sovranty belonging to the Seed of Charles 
which have been wrested from thee, as it is said; 
compensation is due for unjust deeds.


¶44] 
And the island upon which thou didst remain 
when the maiden had departed from thee, thou hand 
unflinching in combat, is the comfortable plain of peace.


¶45] The bird's wings whereby thou didst leave the 
island are the mercenaries of hilly *Banbha*, and the 
companies that surround thee.


¶46] 
And that glue which binds to thee the 
blue-armoured warriors, thou chief of Bregia's ever-roving
host, is the stipend which is dispensed to them.


¶47] 
The other young brother, whose great daring
submerged him, is the people who contend with thee, 
and the kindred which arose on thy behalf.


¶48] 
And the man whom his lowliness of spirit submerged 
answers to those who would tell thee to make 
peace about thy territory.


¶49] 
Thou, O chief of Cong, art come in the middle 
way between them; thou art the elder who wilt surpass 
the rest, thou star of the isles of Ireland.


¶50] 
Thy love who was borne away from thee unjustly,
O sparkling countenance, if she be restored to thee let 
her not be received with humility.


¶51] 
Go forth, thou king of Carra, make fast to thee 
the wings to recover the maiden, thou fair forest-tree of 
*Bearnas*.


¶52] 
This maiden has from childhood's years been wooing 
thee, Richard, this smooth, long-cultivated, fertile land,
this territory of the seed of Charles.


¶53] Thou are most worthy of her, many are the 
reasons, thou stately hero of Bregia's hill, wherefore thy 
patrimony should be lawfully united to thee.




---

p.98


¶54] 
Thou hast the most numerous household, the largest 
number of veterans of battle; difficult it were for any to 
challenge thee, thou best of the sojourners of Ireland.


¶55] Let thy royal seat be filled, Richard, at the quaffing 
of ruddy draughts, with a number sufficient to guard the 
coasts of *Banbha*, a generous, peaceable host.


¶56] 
Let the northern side of the house be occupied 
by Sheela, daughter of Owen, and a flock of fair, modest, 
white-handed maidens, not of the daughters of the Sons 
of *Míl*.


¶57] 
Let the choicest women of the Irish and the English 
fill the apartment around her; a bright-cheeked swarm, 
ungrudging of cattle, disturbance of slumber to the warriors.


¶58] 
Many will be the slender-lipped, bright-cheeked 
beauties feasting with the daughter of the king of *Durlas*, 
like stars in time of frost.


¶59] 
A bevy of cupbearers with crimson beakers 
dispensing wine for her until after sleeping-time to the 
royal stags of the plain of Connacht.


¶60] 
After a time her minstrels, her music-makers, come 
to her; a forest of sweet-stringed, plaintive stems, about 
her soft, spreading locks and blushing cheeks.


¶61] 
The household of the queen of the plain of Cong—
time passes swiftly amongst them; a noble throng, whom 
it is no wonder to love, abounding in witty converse.

p.99


Myler Burke
-----------


¶1] 
Subdue thine arrogant spirit, Myler, forbear, thou 
joyous countenance, to be perpetually plundering the 
children of Conn, thou accomplished, gracious one.


¶2] The disputes of Ulster, the wars of Connacht, are 
severally laid to thy reproach, thou fair and bright of face.


¶3] 
Thou art blamed respectively for what is despoiled 
in Leinster, or in Munster, land of gently flowing rivers, 
O clustering, ringletted tresses.


¶4] 
On thy account, thou broad, lean, gentle countenance, 
many a time, when thou art in repose, there are flights 
from thy reavings one after another in the four quarters 
of Ireland.


¶5] 
Because of the spoilings thou hast wrought thyself, 
thou son of Walter, thou art accused in every part of 
Ireland—noble land of sweetly murmuring streams—
that is devastated.


¶6] 
No wonder that young and uncouth band which 
follows thee in time of stress should be blamed for 
forays, thou shapely, sleek, smooth head.


¶7] 
Men to whom a quilt of snow is a bed of down, 
amorous, ardent youths; a bright, adventurous, agile 
throng, wondrously equipped.


¶8] 
In no place are they so long settled, the young 
and spirited drove, the lawless, barbarian band, as in 
the gloomy cliffs of the heights of *Banbha*.




---

p.100


¶9] 
Alas for him who is king over them, according to 
the look of this roving, active band; their couch grass, 
their feast cold water, these armies of the field of the Gael.


¶10] 
Thy followers are scarcely unlike thyself, thou son 
of Walter; troublesome, careless-minded men, 
scouting-parties of fierce warriors.


¶11] 
They sleep not, they eat not a meal, without 
discussing a battle or an encounter: continual pondering on
forays and wars has dimmed the brightness of their 
glowing cheeks.


¶12] 
The time will come, Myler, when thou wilt regret 
the ways of thy followers, these warriors of keen, 
sadly-wounding spears; a company that will be intolerable.


¶13] 
As it is destined, if it be right to credit prophecy, 
thou wilt forcibly wrest the kingship of Connacht of the 
bright harbors from the hands of the foreign tribe.


¶14] 
They will continue, according to their wont, in 
wars, in roguish exploits, in doing hurt, O bright face, 
beyond any of the host of Croghan's dyked meadow.


¶15] 
As a king thou wilt not be able to suffer injustice 
or disturbance; then will thy dear face regret thy 
forbearance towards thy followers.


¶16] 
Thou wilt make all desist from their wars, thou, 
O waving tresses, wilt defend the Connachtmen from 
the might of reavers, and from the excessive burden of 
the foreign soldiery.


¶17] 
The soothsayers of *Fódla* were assuring the 
possession of the blue isle of the Gael, the fragrant soil 
of Bregian Tara, to thy father.


¶18] 
Thou, O bright, soft countenance, wilt fulfil what 
the druids foretold; thou wilt rescue the country of *Banbha*
from the great oppression of the foreign hosts.


¶19] 
Of thee, O slender form, is foretold that which 
*Aoibheall* prophesied to the noble children of Brian 
*Bóromha*, three fair stems from the soil of *Lugh*'s land.




---

p.101


¶20] 
Three sons of Brian, three lions of *Maicnia*'s
Munster, three royal heirs from the House of Tara;
gracious, comely men.


¶21] 
*Murchadh*, son of Brian, he of the bright hair, 
Tadhg, son of Brian, *Murchadh*'s brother—let one plant 
be chosen above the forest—nobly-born *Donnchadh* was 
their elder.


¶22] 
Murchadh, son of Brian, and Brian himself—these 
fell together, battling with the warriors of Lochlainn for 
bright, fertile *Cliú* and its smooth castles.


¶23] 
Those children of Brian, flower of the vine from 
fair *Cliú*, favorers of the sweet prophetess, were wont to 
obtain tidings from *Aoibheall*.


¶24] 
After a space *Donnchadh* son of Brian goes forth 
to speak with *Aoibheall* concerning the lovely Boyne, 
of smooth yew-trees.


¶25] 
O woman, said *Donnchadh*, declare to me who 
shall be king over the bright western plain in succession 
to Brian? it is not a curious thing to ask.


¶26] 
Tadhg, son of Brian, thine own brother, said 
*Aoibheall* thereupon, to him has the House of Tara, 
dwelling with varied vestures, been promised.


¶27] 
After this converse *Donnchadh* became filled with 
envy of Tadhg of *Banbha*; it is hard to bridle a woman's 
foolish speech, the hero's reason became subverted.


¶28] Therefore he fratricidally slew the heir to the 
kingship of *Fódla*, and said that he had refuted *Aoibheall*
regarding that descendant of *Tál* and *Éibhear* Fionn.


¶29] 
*Aoibheall* came to reproach him when *Donnchadh*
was left alone in [*...*]*(?)* Kincora, by the bright, fair, blue-streamed rampart.


¶30] 
It is unjust for thee to say that my prophecy
was false, said *Aoibheall*, my words regarding the noble 
mate of Bregia's castle are certain, said the maiden.




---

p.102


¶31] 
For the heir of a high-king and for the heir's son 
the prophecy is the same, it is said; have faith in what I say 
regarding the pleasant, flowery plain of swaying yews.


¶32] 
What I promised to *Tadhg* of Tara, *Tadhg*'s son 
Turlogh shall receive; stag of the royal flock of the noble 
line of Cas, finest vinestalk of the Fergus.


¶33] 
Turlogh, son of *Tadhg*, assumed sovranty over 
every part of Ireland—fair, pleasant land of graceful 
streams—even as *Aoibheall* had foreseen.


¶34] 
Even thus it will befall thee as regards this land, 
thou gracious form, thou wilt win supremacy over 
*Meadhbh*'s Country, thou stately, white-footed youth.


¶35] 
*Aoibheall* promised the Country of *Lugh* to *Tadhg*, 
son of Brian *Bóroimhe*, and Turlogh—sustaining pillar 
of Tara's stead—had the profit thereof.


¶36] 
The druids of *Banbha* have ever been prophesying 
that *Cobhthach*'s Plain—restful land of firm forest trees—
would come to Walter, son of Mac William.


¶37] 
Walter, O crimson lips, died as he was about to 
become king, for thee, thou defending arm of Meath's 
hill, will the prophecy be fruitful.


¶38] 
The province, thou graceful form, was full, of 
dissensions upon Walter's death, full of wars and battles 
and wrong and harm.


¶39] 
Since thou hast gotten warrior's weapons the rest 
have not dared to think of their enmities, to speak of
war, or to use force, thou ripe fruit of the vine.


¶40] It was thy fathers death that hid the fruits of the 
forests, the fish of the bay; and it is the reason 
wherefore the moon and sun were fettered.


¶41] 
There come with thee, as thou hast come, the 
flowering of those woods, the corn of the tilth, the 
produce of the streams; each element recognizing thy 
tokens.




---

p.103


¶42] Behold the fully sprung corn, behold the moon 
shining brightly, why should there be any distrust of 
thy claim to the bright-walled land of Connacht?


¶43] 
Moon and wind and sun, stars of heaven and clouds 
of the sky are favoring thee, thou lord of Gorumna, the 
sea is about proclaim thee.

p.104


*A COMPLAINT*
-------------


¶1] 
Thou messenger going across the moor, speak yonder 
with William Burke; tell him of the plight that I am in, 
without any prospect of help.


¶2] 
Tell him moreover, in secret, that there is no shelter 
for me on land or on sea; that no one before was ever 
afflicted with half of my injustice or one third of my 
wrong.


¶3] 
I have been paying my share for two years or
three, and after that all the liabilities of others are levied
from me.


¶4] 
When I saw the liabilities of the others being all 
wrested from me, I went to the courthouse to see if I 
could obtain right or justice.


¶5] 
In going to the court I myself spent—to my sorrow, 
and that is not all, in ridding myself of that trouble—
whatever little I possessed.


¶6] 
I fetch with me a good warrant, and return full of 
spirits; I thought that I was safe after my visit to the 
great court.


¶7] 
I display my own patent to the [*...*]*(?)*, when the 
had read my letters, I got even less consideration *(?)*.


¶8] 
My captain, each of the two to whom I go again 
lamenting, swears by the glove of Christ that it is not his 
part to hinder them.


¶9] The sheriff that was in charge of us, this is what
my precious fellow says to me; you trust to the creditors,
it is not the solider that will lack anything.


¶10] It did not satisfy any of them to take one gage
alone from me; in payment of the fines of the rest I had
to render two or three gages into the hand of each man.




---

p.105


¶11] 
I spent a long time going from place to place in 
search of the gage; not only is my gage taken from 
me, but I redeem it twice or thrice.


¶12] 
When I would redeem it from the first man that 
held it he from whom it was redeemed in the beginning{?) 
would hand it on to the next.


¶13] 
I go promptly in pursuit of the gage, whether it 
be carried far or near; I never returned home till I had
spent six times the price.


¶14] 
Then as for the President, to whom I would go 
to relate my case; with tears on my cheeks I used to 
make complaints to him, sternly and bitterly.


¶15] He says gruffly, that not by his will would a
gage be taken from me; that, however, I can give 
payment for it eventually.


¶16] 
It is not for my goods I am most grieved, but 
that when I lost my fortune none remained to support 
me, for I was left destitute in the end.


¶17] 
The horseboy, the cowherd, the quern-girl, the
comb-woman—they all went from me at once, along
with a solider; a wretched deed.


¶18] 
This is what my own cowherd, of all those that 
deserted me, says, showing me*(?)* the fire: What keeps 
you from drawing up?'.


¶19] 
I have been, there is no reason for hiding it, under 
dire oppression these three years; in hope for the coming 
of William Burke I did not make much of it.


¶20] 
God's curse on those dealers in lies that do not 
verify their stories; everyone whispers to me that William 
Burke is here.


¶21] 
Thou messenger going to meet him, pay no heed 
to fun or sport; speak with my own companion, and see 
if he has yet come.


¶22] 
Lion's whelp of Loch Con, salmon of the Shannon's 
bright streams, hound of the inlet of Assaroe, much do 
I expect from his coming.

p.106


RICHARD *ÓG* BURKE
------------------


¶1] 
Give heed to thyself, Richard *Óg*g, do not forsake 
thine early disposition; if one might say so much to thee, 
it were more fitting to be as thou hast been.


¶2] Be, even as thou hast ever been, Richard son of 
Mac William; alas, if thou shouldst assume any other 
rank, thou gentle, supple scion of *Mucroimhe*.


¶3] 
Thou wouldst do ill, O pure face, to change that 
former name, considering all it hath won for thy bright 
hand, with it thou didst increase in prowess.


¶4] The mantle from which a man derives customary 
good health. O pleasant countenance, he loves that 
garment, thou sacred stag of Bregia's fair territory.


¶5] 
The place where one succeeds in increasing his 
wealth, that is the post on which he is stayed, he is not 
easily expelled beyond its borders.


¶6] 
The boy who is sent to his own land from the 
country in which he is reared, after his nursing therein, 
thou bright hand, the boy and its people are hard to 
separate.


¶7] 
Even thus it were not for thee to part from thy 
wonted title, thy well-known deeds, with every triumph 
that thou hadst of old, since from it was got all that 
thou didst win.


¶8] 
O son of Richard, gentle of heart, as for the foreign 
title thou hast got, never didst thou gain any advantage 
from it that the fame of the former title did not outdo.




---

p.107


¶9] 
Didst them get the headship of Flann's Plain it 
would not advantage thee, thou gallant form, in thy 
native place, to reign over *Banbha* by a foreign title.


¶10] 
Even I—it were not worth thy while for the sake 
of a hazardous and shortlived title, thou warrior who 
hauntest the border of *Banbha*, that I should not get an
opportunity of speech with thee.


¶11] 
Am I not all the more emboldened to say to
thee, though it should mean an eric leviable against me, 
thou scion ordained above the blood of Conn, that there 
is a reproach between us!


¶12] 
Not happily didst thou obtain the strange title, or 
the horrid outlandish right, about which I make bold 
against thee, thou diadem of Connacht's first assembly.


¶13] 
Whatever land in which I might chance to fall, 
under any of the kings of Ireland, even though I should 
not seek a price for my blood I should deserve vengeance 
from thee.


¶14] 
Didst thou fail me of thine own part, thou wouldst 
still owe, thou offspring of high-kings, to bear the part of 
the queen of Galway's field with those who should 
avenge our displeasure.


¶15] 
It was seldom for us and for you, blood of the 
luminously judging Burkes, to whom shall fall the 
guardianship of Ireland, to be contending with one another.


¶16] 
Any offences that our people ever used commit 
against Clanwilliam, ours would be the honorprice there
for, thou powerfully attended champion of Man.


¶17] 
Unfitting is it, if thou follow the dealings of their 
poets with their princes, thou charmed diadem from the 
fairy mound of Knowth, that the eric of such as I should 
not be paid.


¶18] 
Even as the fragrant blossoms of Clanwilliam ever 
did, do thou, O forest tree of Bregia's height, about 
thy poet's reproach.




---

p.108


¶19] 
In the name of poetry we forbid thee to change 
thy title; thou shouldst renounce the new appellation 
rather than lose thy patrimony.


¶20] Let me find thee again in thine own shape, thou 
champion of the Plain of royal Niall; thou must make
speed, give up thy strangeness towards us.


¶21] Thou wert the sinew of *Banbha*'s land until thou
didst get the outlandish title; the sheriffship of Conn's
seed would not compensate for leaving sinewless the 
fair hunting-field of *Íor*.


¶22] Thou madest a deceptive bargain, an exchange 
not to be persisted in, thou triumphant champion of 
Bregia's hill, thou shalt regret the deed.


¶23] 
The worse for thee that thou didst not meet with 
the son of the French knight the day the new name 
was bestowed upon thee as a condition of receiving thy 
patrimony.


¶24] 
Once on a time the knight's son, feeling vigor in 
his arm, thought to explore the world, in hope to find 
marvels.


¶25] 
Despite his father's wish the youth set forth—
what greater delusion?—active form, most steadfast of 
purpose, he would take no counsel to change.


¶26] A precious stone in the full size of his fist did his 
father entrust to the youth, wrought with exceeding 
nobleness was it, and dyed in gold.


¶27] 
Search the world from sea to sea with my gilded 
stone, said the father, bestow it, thou bright, soft-limbed 
fellow, upon him who is most foolish of purpose.


¶28] 
The young noble bade farewell to his kinsfolk, 
courteous, firm in exploit, he left his fatherland.


¶29] 
After his sweetly-speaking, pleasant, sprightly 
figure had travelled the world, the youth—what greater 
strength?—found himself in a certain strange land.




---

p.109


¶30] He sees from afar a multitude of people, a great
royal city; he hears many cries from the people
round the brightly-roofed, shapely castle.


¶31] 
He hears then, about the noble, stately city, on 
the hills hard by the enclosure, cries of sorrow and 
delight alternating.


¶32] 
Afar off, before drawing near the city, he enquired 
from the first man he met the reason for that assembly.


¶33] 
That man said: those people thou seest before 
thee, clan by clan, are the inhabitants of the land.


¶34] 
There is in this country, went on the young man, 
a strange, alarming custom; their king, even though he 
break not their law, reigns over them but for one year.


¶35] 
At the end of the year they leave him out on 
the sea, in a lonely island; alas for the king whose 
patrimony is the stately city thou seest.


¶36] 
Every king who has departed from us will spend 
his life from this on without friend or companion, see if 
there be anything more pitiful under heaven!


¶37] 
This assembly around thee are making a new king 
to-day, having banished the former one, a deed to pacify 
a multitude.


¶38] 
These hosts beside thee are choosing a new king, 
on account of nobility and birth, that is the cause of 
their gathering.


¶39] 
These cries thou hearest from all, this is their 
import, said the young man, 'a king being proclaimed 
by some of them, simultaneously with the lament for the
former king.


¶40] 
The youth proceeded thereupon with his precious 
stone to meet them; the affable, ruddy, bright fellow 
remembered the admonition of his father.


¶41] 
That day into the hand of the king the youth—
what greater contempt?—delivered the many-virtued, 
splendid stone, he earned thereby an upspringing of 
contention.

p.110


¶42] What is the reason thou hast put into my hand 
this precious stone, or dost thou wish to sell it, thou 
strange youth? said the high-king.


¶43] 
My father, said he, said to me; when thou hast 
searched the world, my son, bestow on the most surpassing 
simpleton the golden stone we have delivered to thee.


¶44] 
By thee, now—therefore hast thou received the 
stone—has been committed a deed the most foolish under 
heaven, O glistening, kindly eye.


¶45] 
Thy long life, and thine own inheritance, hast 
thou given, what senselessness, O noble, splendid form, 
for the sake of one year of supremacy.


¶46] 
The king paid heed to the pleasant speech of the 
young noble, and having found true guidance, he publicly 
renounced the kingship.


¶47] 
I would have given to thy bright face, if I had 
it, that man's stone, thou apple-blossom of Kincora, when 
thou didst change thy title.


¶48] 
Thou gavest, thou ruddy form, an abiding name 
in exchange for a temporary one: O fighter of Bregia's 
gaily-tinged hill, that was an imprudent deed of thine.


¶49] 
All that thou didst obtain from the beginning by 
that renowned jewel of a name was worth enough, thou 
star from Cormac's noble Plain, that thou shouldst not 
displace it.


¶50] 
With it, as Richard *Óg*, in youthful days long 
ago, thou hadst as profitable a time as ever man had, 
throughout the bright plain of the Gael.


¶51] 
Of yore thou wouldst spend a day in ravaging the 
shores of *Bóromha*, a day by the soft, shallow streams, 
of the Boyle, a day by the flats of *Bearnas*.


¶52] 
A day by the babbling streams of Bonet, another 
in Erris; a day by Tara of Meath, and by noble, ancient 
Loch Sewdy.




---

p.111


¶53] 
Equally didst thou explore the brinks of *Forbhar*, 
the borders of Sligo; from them as far as Croghan of 
Conn, and from Croghan-eastwards to the Shannon.


¶54] 
The track of thy steeds one would trace from 
Achill's point to Ushnagh, without a man swerving 
therefrom, from Bunduff to Loch Derg.


¶55] 
All would say, O kindly figure, that as 'son of Mac 
William' never, though thou borest no strange title, wert 
thou humbled in a fray{?).


¶56] 
The old name, O lord of Cong, well didst thou 
do to alter it did the fair curves of thy countenance find 
therefrom any reason to blush.


¶57] 
Those who know thee from childhood's years are 
challenged to say if thou didst ever meddle with anything 
on earth that would earn reproach for a man, thou lord 
of fair Loch Corrib.


¶58] 
Thou son of Joan, from the fairy mound of Trim, 
if there be variance between us, it should not be long 
persisted in, lest the fair curves of the cheek be scorched.

WILLIAM BURKE
-------------


¶1] 
God's justice between me and William! not well 
did the generous and gifted nobleman—even though it 
be possible to make peace about it—suffer such as I to 
be harmed.


¶2] 
It were not worth his while, without cause or reason, 
seeing that he, bright face, hath proper objects of plunder, 
to rob any man on earth of what he had gained by his art.


¶3] 
Even if his slender hand were continually plundering 
the poets of Ireland, surely the flower of those stems 
from the Bregian Boyne would have no right to despoil me.


¶4] 
Never before was there a portion that William and 
I did not divide—though it was destined for his bright 
cheek that by him I should be deliberately ruined.


¶5] 
I was his poet, but none the meeter was it that he 
should meddle with my goods because I was called his 
follower and there was a bond of art between us.


¶6] 
Long before, moreover, I was to William a pupil, 
a teacher; I used to impart learning to him, loyal, rosy 
countenance, and receive it from him.


¶7] 
All the parchments of learning, the strain of music, 
the improvised couplet, each one of these that he studied 
I used to expound to the man.


¶8] 
The book I used not to read myself he, bright face, 
would impart it to me, so that his fair hand was my 
noble instructor; it is a shawl which is the thinner from 
its folding.




---

p.113


¶9] Such learning and knowledge did he obtain from 
me that he was my special pupil; he to rob me is a 
sentence of bondage, he was my tutor in the elements.


¶10] I was his master, his pupil; his companion, his 
comrade; not well did he forthwith obtain my cattle; 
unjustly he went to despoil me.


¶11] Not well did he forget, when about to plunder 
me, that I was his follower, and that I and the fair, 
long-fingered fellow, William, used to be together over 
one book.


¶12] Moreover, even had I not been, as I am, his pupil, 
it was no meet action for him of the [*...*]tresses to 
snatch her gold from poesy.


¶13] 
Even had I not been tutor to the valorous champion 
of Fannad [*...*]


¶14] 
[*...*]


¶15] 
I have served—alas for me that served—in all 
these forms ye hear, though the griffin of the Erne be 
now an enemy, the author of my hurt.


¶16] 
It was none the wiser for William to attack me 
because he knew that I would not avenge my angering 
or my wrong on the royal star of the lands of Connacht.


¶17] 
He himself knew that I would not satirize his 
bright cheek—alas, that any should see me plundered 
by the man—for anything in the world he might do.


¶18] 
I would not, it were not for me to do so, satirize the 
precipitous flood *(?)* of the blood of the earls, a plant of 
the fair-haired race of Conn I would not satirize for the 
gold of Ireland.


¶19] 
I would not, it were not for me to do so—satirize 
a griffin of Conall Gulban's stock, I would not, he did 
not fear it, satirize a dragon of the noble race of Charles.




---

p.114


¶20] 
I would not satirize the serpentlike venom of the 
blood of sternly-judging Brian, or the keen, bright, leonine 
countenance of the true flesh and blood of noble Niall's 
descendant.


¶21] 
I would not for the sake of cattle dispraise the 
fierce, blow-dealing champion of the remnant of Core's 
thirsty-speared seed, and of the progeny of famous *Íor*.


¶22] 
I know that the satirizing of the brown-browed 
warrior, oppressive though I deem his foray, would not 
be left unpunished by the kindreds of the high-kings 
of Ireland.


¶23] 
Even were no one on earth shielding him from 
me—bright, richly curling, waving tresses—I could not 
satirize William.

SORLEY MACDONNELL
-----------------


¶1] 
Long has *Fódla* had a claim upon Alba, now is the 
time to urge it; provided she get her own rights it is 
not likely that Ireland will be loft mateless.


¶2] 
For a long space of time that land of Alba has 
owed a due to *Cobhthach*'s lime-visaged castle; a cause 
of dissension to the Scots.


¶3] 
Alba of the shallow streams should deliver her dues 
to the isle of Ireland, indulating land of rippling waterfalls, 
lest there be disagreement between them.


¶4] 
What new claim to-day has the land of the Children 
of *Míl*, tell me if thou knowest—, whereby she sues 
the isle of Alba?


¶5] 
The heavy tribute which Balor imposed upon Ireland 
—it would be an awakening of conflict for her to do it—
is that what *Banbha* would claim?


¶6] Or is it the isles in the east between *Fódla* and 
Alba, and each tract of the fair plain of Islay, or ancient 
Cantire with its limpid streams?


¶7] 
The land of Eber is not thinking of any of those 
things you suppose, but of something more difficult to 
levy, something about which she has been in want.


¶8] 
The three Collas, children of haughty *Eachaidh 
Doimlén*, this is the end of their story: they went to the 
land of Alba, three with whom it were unfitting to vie.


¶9] 
Two of the three came hither to Bregia's land of 
fairy hills, the choicest of the host have ever since 
remained away from us in the Plain of *Monadh*.




---

p.116


¶10] 
It is strange that Colla himself and his ancient 
race, stately men with perilous weapons, from that time 
suffered their inheritance to be lacking to them.


¶11] 
Why should the Children of Colla, for whatever 
arose between them, render allegiance to a strange, foreign 
land rather than to *Banbha* plain of brightly-waving,
crops ?


¶12] 
Who is the lord of the blood of keen-sworded 
Colla whom *Banbha* is expecting ? If she has chosen 
one of the race of Alba, it were fitting that she should be 
freed from rivalry *(?)*


¶13] 
The best-beloved of Conn's Dwelling, Sorley, son 
of MacDonnell, the expected mate from *Monadh*'s Plain, 
he for whom Ireland is waiting.


¶14] 
Fruitful branch of Tara of the Fair Folk, bright 
sun after a downpour, fortunate spray from the 
apple-trees of Islay, star of favorable summer weather.


¶15] 
Most favored offspring of Colla's seed, arm that 
banishes foreigners, fruit of the apple-plant of Bregia's 
soil, sustainer of the five fifths.


¶16] 
[*...*] cause of grief, until she sued Sorley, the land 
of *Banbha* under a burden of barbarians, their *(her?)* claim 
has remained unsettled.


¶17] 
Ireland, in brief, will separate the best warrior of 
*Domhnall*'s race, fierce, fair, splendid heroes, from the 
ancient, wondrous plain of Alba.


¶18] 
I have read in an ancient parchment a story which 
touches the race of Colla, the curious tale which will be 
unfolded will be fresh unto the end.


¶19] 
The hero of the story which will be unfolded to 
thee—Caesar, the famed high-king—departed from the 
land of Italy with an army of splendid warriors.


¶20] Westwards from Rome they travelled to Spain's
yew-treed soil, a goodly band of adventurers, they had 
not come on an embassy *(?)*




---

p.117


¶21] 
Caesar of the scatheless hosts loved the west of 
Europe, he consented to remain away from Rome, yet 
separation was not agreable to both.


¶22] 
When he had remained away for some time, one 
day after retiring to repose he beheld a wondrous vision, 
it was a prospect of help for the king to behold it.


¶23] 
It seemed to him that he found beside him, in the 
guise of a lovely, graceful woman, Rome, recounting her 
hardships, matter for condemnation.


¶24] 
Rome with streams of tears down her bright cheek, 
with locks dishevelled in sorrowful aspect, was bewailing 
her wrong, fitting was it to lament over what she said.


¶25] 
It should not seem fitting to thee, said Rome, 
for me to be as I am now in thy absence, with no 
prospect of succour, overcome by outlandish men.


¶26] 
To defend a fortress that is not thine own is 
astonishing for thee, thou keen-weaponed soldier, whilst 
thine own and, after being ravaged, is being wrested 
from thee by barbarians.


¶27] 
These were the words of Caesar: O Rome of 
the smoothly-fashioned rampart, whether I be brought 
eastwards or remain here, I have striven to be obedient 
to thee.


¶28] 
I would say to thee, said Rome, bring with thee 
the full muster of thy following, gather thy splendid 
warriors to invade the soil of Italy.


¶29] 
Hesitate no longer, shameful for thee is thy chamber 
of slumber since foreigners have arranged it*(?)* though 
it be terrifying to face them.


¶30] 
He took with him eastwards the warriors of Greece, 
the soldiery of Europe, it was a time for display (?}, to 
defend stately Rome, a most righteous action when 
considered.




---

p.118


¶31] 
I Caesar, in brief, after the tyrannies she had suffered, 
delivered the wondrous limewashed castles of Rome from 
the power of the wicked host of barbarians.


¶32] 
*Banbha* spouse of Conn, like Rome of old, will 
bring her own man from the Plain of *Monadh*, that is 
the meaning of what ye have heard.


¶33] 
MacDonnell's son sees before him in a vision, ere 
he falls into slumber, fair and generous *Banbha*bewailing 
her oppression.


¶34] 
Even as Caesar came the son of Alastar will come 
now to the Bregian Boyne to aid everyone, with a 
following difficult to number.


¶35] 
Even as Caesar's hosts won to Rome, through 
*Lorc*'s Field, with, the full muster of his following, will 
come the Caesar of Colla's race, the pick of a choice 
gleaning.


¶36] 
From the playful, melodious Moy, so famed for 
treasure *(?)* as far as the Peak of *Éadar*, son of *Éadghaoth*, 
there will spring forth from the edges of the strands a 
veritable forest of sail-trimmed masts of majestic ships.


¶37] 
He will discharge the debt of his forefathers to 
the land of Bregia, following in their wake he will occupy 
the plain of smooth standards and many [*...*]{?} eastwards 
to the ancient castle of Tara.


¶38] 
Though Eber's land submitted not to that Colla 
*Uais* from whom thou art sprung, the ancient line of 
Colla possessed her, she is an inheritance unfit for division.


¶39] 
Do we count a single king, from Colla back to 
*Gaedheal Glas*, who did not seize the headship of Ireland, 
if that knowledge prove an exhortation to them ?


¶40] 
Without leave from us, the three Collas, champions 
from *Baoi*'s clear, sail-bright bay, surrendered Ireland 
through envy, for one day's hard-won victory in battle.




---

p.119


¶41] 
Sorley, timely it is, will speedily issue a ban, he 
will not fulfil the ancient contract of the Collas about 
the land of Frewin.


¶42] 
About Cashel, about Croghan of *Aoi*, about the 
brightly-wooded Hill of Alien, and *Oileach* with its faultless 
steeds, the ancient covenant of all will be revoked.


¶43] 
Because of the ban which Sorley shall declare, 
*Banbha*is about to mate, a troop hath come to levy her, 
the Boyne will rejoice at that ban.

p.120


MAELMORA MACSWEENY
------------------


¶1] 
One night I came to *Eas Caoille*, till the Day of 
Doom shall I remember it; when the fortress itself shall 
have perished there shall still remain forever the events 
of that night, the doings of all *(who were present)*.


¶2] 
The like of the men whom I found in the polished 
bright-hued castle, on the shapely benches of the crimson 
fortress, eye never saw before.


¶3] 
But few remain of the beloved company whom I 
found in the bright castle, the death of the four that were 
within was a grief from which *Banbha*did not look to 
recover.


¶4] I found Maelmora MacSweeny on the central bench 
of the graceful mansion, a man of generous and pleasant 
manner, favorite pupil of the schools of Conn's land.


¶5] Dear as life to me was the man I found in that 
domed castle with its ivory-hilted swords; as I have 
experienced twice its value of misery from *(the loss of)*
it, the honor I received from him is the worse from its 
greatness.


¶6] Both pupil and fosterer to the poets of *Banbha*
throughout his days was the chess-king of the Finn;
the goal of our emulation, our ready gift, storehouse of 
the hearts of the learned.


¶7] 
Our healing herb, our sleep charm, our fruitful 
branch, our house of treasure; a piece of steel, yet one 
who never denied any man, most precious offspring of 
the Grecian Gaels.




---

p.121


¶8] 
I found beside the son of Maelmurray many men of 
letters worthy of recompense, while the choicest of every 
craft in the world were also reclining beside the chief of *Derg*.


¶9] Till the day of his death the poets of the host of 
the House of Trim were ever with the chief of Conn's 
tribe in a gathering large enough for battle or assembly.


¶10] 
At that time in particular there sat by the warrior 
of Loch Key—well did their scholarship become them—
three of the poets of *Té*'s Hill.


¶11] 
There was the poet of the Earl of the Burkes, and 
also by his soft bosom was one of whom the very mention 
was a surety, the poet of the famous race of Niall.


¶12] 
There was the poet of the chieftain of the Moy, 
Mac William Burke of just awards—discouraging in sooth 
are the changes of the world, that not one of these 
remains is in itself a sermon.


¶13] 
Brian O'Donnellan, kindly countenance, poet to the 
lion of Loughrea; he with the schools as the moon above 
stars, peace to his gallant, noble form.


¶14] 
Brian Macnamee, son of Angus, poet to the 
descendant of Nine-Hostaged Niall; a man whose 
attainment *(?)* was the best of his time, he was fit to 
deliver wisdom's pledge.


¶15] 
Conor, grandson of O'Huiginn, poet to the lord of 
Inishkea, almost equal to a prince was the poet, the head 
of his kindred in worth.


¶16] 
The three poets that I found by the ruddy, fair-skinned 
hero—let a trio such as they be found in the 
land of *Banbha*!


¶17] 
With one accord they arise before me from beside 
the chieftain who was my chieftain: often I think of 
them in my heart, the utterances of the three drawing 
tears from my eyes.




---

p.122


¶18] 
The soothing strains of [*...*]*(?)* harps, the sweetness 
of honey, the elation of ale—alas, that he of whom I had 
them no longer lives—these gave me pleasure.


¶19] 
For a while after my arrival they drank to me—
gentlemen were their attendants—from cups of gold, 
from goblets of horn.


¶20] 
When we had gone to our couches of rest to 
slumber, ere the coming of day, he who lay furthest 
from me would not admit that to be thus was not a 
sentence of bondage.


¶21] 
I lay in the midst of the four, the four forms that 
were most dear to me, the three comrades who have 
grieved my heart, and the champion of *Magh Meann*.


¶22] 
To the blossom of Tara and his three companions 
I relate a tale in return for reward; its dearness was a 
portent of fame for them, golden youth of the north.


¶23] 
Four treasures endowed with virtue I take from 
them in payment for my story; that the like of the 
princely jewels may not be found—is not that enough 
to color one's tears ?


¶24] 
As the first award I was allowed I took the dappled 
steed from the hero of steed-abounding Slieve Gamph, 
him at whose death hospitality perished.


¶25] 
The dappled steed that I took from Maelmora—
woe is me that I took it—hardly is there its like in the 
world, a steed surpassing all the steeds of Bregian *Banbha*.


¶26] 
From Brian son of Angus I took the choicest 
hound of *Dá Thí*'s Plain; its excellence was such as to 
place it above all other hounds, it was one of the choice 
hounds of the world.


¶27] 
It had been easier for Brian to renounce one by 
one all of the treasures of Ireland—wherefore should 
this not depress my spirit?—than his treasure of a noble 
handsome hound.




---

p.123


¶28] From Brian son of Owen, ere the fair, rosy, kindly
fellow slept, I got as a reward for my story a precious
book, a brimming spring of the genuine stream of knowledge.


¶29] The 'Cattle-raids', 'Wooings', 'Destructions' of all 
the world were in the gift I received, with descriptions
of the battles and exploits thereof, it was the flower of
the royal books of Ireland.


¶30] Conor gave the magic harp, such a precious jewel
as even a king would not bestow; long has that present 
been a sorrowful inheritance, it was no fitting gift from 
a poet.


¶31] The harp of the poet of the Burkes will be ever
an object of reverence; he from whom it was got is 
no-more, but it remains in freshness to day.


¶32] Alas for him by whom the givers of these were 
beloved, since it was destined that he should part from
them; men never *Fál* in the house of election, men who
loved to spread their fame.


¶33] 
Alas for my beloved four, my bed-fellows, my 
confidants; four stems from a fruitful forest, trees fertile 
in gifts for us.


¶34] 
My reason wanders, restless is my mind after that 
shortlived company; alas for him who remains on earth 
without them, departing, they have left Brian's *Banbha*
without fruits.


¶35] lt is a heartbreak that the chief of the band which
was within should be lacking to us; never before did 
poet lack the generous gift of his stout heart.


¶36] May God requite Maelmora for the quantity of
his wealth that I received; one who bestowed as much 
as any man gave, the benefactor of all.


¶37] 
Suave in utterance, stern in resolve, ruthless in 
deeds, modest in speech; guardian of every man of his 
kindred, judge, soldier, poet, soothsayer.




---

p.124


¶38] Treasure of contention of the race of *Breóghan*, 
winning of their game, defence of their pledge; 
satisfaction of the hearts of troublesome guests, love of 
melodious, merry, graceful women.


¶39] Prudent preparation*(?)*, generous disposition, a 
keeping of word, a breaking of peace; bright countenance 
from which the eyes could scarce wander, nursing 
knee of royal rule.


¶40] Solving of problems, posing of counter-problems, 
Inisfail's anvil of knowledge *(?)*; hate of perpetual ease, 
love of conflict, surety for the peace and war of all.


¶41] The son of *Gormlaidh*, a branch above the wood, 
keen in mind, gentle in response—where is his like for 
bestowing a troublesome award? sternness and generosity 
he has in equal parts.


¶42] Though I have been in poverty since he fell, I 
should be above all the land of *Fál* *(in affluence)* if only 
Maelmora—lime-white skin, countenance of amber—
remained.


¶43] The remembrance of what I got from my friend 
will soon be but an omen of grief; I shall fear lest the 
greatness of my honor should come to me again in illusion.


¶44] Alas, not many of my comrades remain to me in 
their own shape; the world has cast me away, sending 
me travelling afar in solitude.


¶45] Pitiful it is to lack my three comrades, the race 
of *Gormlaidh*, from whom the day was short; *Banbha*, 
who looked for help from this clan, is now under a cloud 
of sorrow.

p.125


OWEN ÓG MACSWEENEY
------------------


¶1] 
It is they themselves who repress the race of Niall, 
lords of the fertile land of *Fódla*; through the jealousy 
of Bregia's gold-decked host the glory of the Gael has 
ever suffered decrease.


¶2] The sunny soil of the isle of *Fódla*, upon the death 
of their father the eight sons of Nine-hostaged Niall—a 
band used to peril—divided it.


¶3] The share of *Maine*, fierce *Laoghaire*, *Fiacha*, and Conall *Criomthainn* was the level of Bregia's 
ruddy-beakered Plain, the ancient territory of *Tailte*'s Dwelling.


¶4] To mighty Conall of wide renown, to *Cairbre*, *Énna* 
and *Eóghan*, the royal slopes of the North were given 
by the fiery impetuous host.


¶5] There were two amongst the spirited offspring of 
the high king who surpassed the others, they resembled 
not the rest of Niall's noble progeny, although they were 
stems of the same tree.


¶6] *Eóghan*, son of Niall of the Nine Fetters, Conall 
Gulban, the fierce griffin, they and the other sons were 
not the same.


¶7] *Eóghan* and rightly-judging Conall, two sons of 
mighty Niall, son of *Eachaidh*, of one birth, it is said, 
were these princes with smooth, glistening skin.


¶8] On the day on which the two infants were born a 
contentious disposition inspired the noble, highspirited 
offspring, two stems from a single vine.


¶9] Upon their birth each one of the bright-faced, 
impetuous pair was found—omen of conflict—hugging 
the head of his companion in his arm.




---

p.126


¶10] As for these children of powerful Niall, Conall and
valorous *Eóghan*, they were never afterwards free from 
a battlesome disposition or from the throes of war.


¶11] Their seed from that time onward have been 
following in the wake of that pair, ever full of envy 
towards one another about *Conaire*'s hazel-abounding land.


¶12] Raid for raid, wound for wound, have been constantly 
exchanged between the seed of Conall and the 
race of *Eóghan*, much harm do we know them to be 
answerable for.


¶13] For a long time the seed of the two heroes of the 
land of *Ealg* were balanced in arms as regards the plain 
of Tara, hurtful to themselves were their ravages.


¶14] The fruit of the fertile stems held the supremacy 
of *Úghaine*'s plain alternately down to the time of *Aodh 
Athlamhain*.


¶15] At *Aodh* the seed of *Eóghan* divide, it befell them
—what disloyalty—to overthrow one another's power; 
they themselves revoke their own rights.


¶16] When their alliance *(?)* dissolved in the time of 
famed Aodh *Athlamhain* the clan *Suibhne* parted from 
the race of Niall, warriors who never earned reproach.


¶17] After that the race of *Suibhne* made with propitious 
counsel an alliance with the noble youth of the race of 
Conn in fertile Tirconell.


¶18] The lords of Conall's tribe gave to *Suibhne*'s 
nobly-judging stock their choice of the spreading, pleasant, 
fertile land from sea to sea.


¶19] From that day forward—evil the bond which came 
upon them—the seed of *Suibhne* allowed no man of 
*Eóghan* race to have possession of the kingship.


¶20] Since that the seed of *Suibhne* have levied 
throughout the fair, grassy plain a claim out of every part of 
Ireland for our tribe of Conall.




---

p.127


¶21] Until the race of *Suibhne* made conquests for our 
race of Conall, Ireland was held by the descendants of 
*Eóghan*, graceful scions from *Cobhthach's*, fold.


¶22] From that day to this the chief of Conall's noble 
tribe has overcome the rest of the warriors of the Gael 
in every contest for the land of Flann.


¶23] Now to the seed of *Suibhne* anew, and to the race 
of Conall of the plain of *Bearnas*, there has come an 
arm to maintain their rights upon the gracefully-spreading 
northern land.


¶24] Owen *Óg*, son of Mac Sweeny, guarding shield of 
the coast of Mourne; one fit to wage war for Conn's 
descendants, a spark in the embers for Conall's race.


¶25] Precious salmon from the stream of the Finn, a 
sunny day after a downpour; stately figure, cool in 
conflict, the Ulstermen's gilded stem.


¶26] The battle champion of *Dálach*'s kindreds, a man 
who ennobles their annals; lucky treasure of the gentle 
race of Conn, shepherd of Conall's flock.


¶27] As long as Mac Sweeny remains with the hot-bladed 
seed of Conall it will be profitless for a man to 
speak of a contest for the apple-branched land of the Gael.


¶28] Never have the seed of Conall of the plain of 
*Úghaine* been mightier than they are now, thanks to the 
hero of *Bearnas'* varied plain.


¶29] While keen-weaponed Owen lives the king of 
Conall's race will not find a chief to oppose him in Ireland's 
bright-foliaged land.


¶30] A wood is stooped by the growth of its stems, 
the pledge of every man of *Eóghan*'s kin is brought 
back by the son of Margaret to the deeply-wounding 
soldiery of *Bearnas*.


¶31] Had not the lords of noble Niall's race been attacked 
by their own side all Ireland would have been no match for 
*Eóghan*'s, line, the flower of *Monadh*'s slender-fingered host.

¶32] Even thus was Troy overthrown, victorious city 
bordered with flourishing woods, sloping plains with the 
choicest of lime-washed ramparts—from the envy of 
kinsmen about it.


¶33] The famed king Agamemnon and all his following 
set out to capture it with the Grecian host, a band 
dangerous to oppose.


¶34] Each day a fresh slaughter was inflicted around 
Troy by the soldiery on both sides, famous, mightily 
courageous warriors.


¶35] After more than ten years, piteous the siege, they 
had not succeeded in taking Troy by force; to attempt 
it was a formidable task for any man.


¶36] Had they remained around it from that day to 
this, with the full strength of their forces, it is not likely 
that the Grecians would have captured the green-branched, 
turreted castle.


¶37] It befell it, treachery enough, that some of those 
within delivered it to them, even when the attack was 
repulsed and none remaining around it.


¶38] Had not the stately fortress of the bright ramparts 
been forced from within, all the armies in the world would 
not be likely to demolish Troy, you would have said.


¶39] Regarding the supremacy of *Lughaidh's* plain even 
thus it befell the soldiery of *Eóghan*'s race, the 
apple-branches from *Eamhain*.


¶40] Until some of their tiwn folk turned against them, 
the land of Bregia was held by *Eóghan*'s race, without 
desire of fight or attempt at conflict, neither refusing nor 
accepting battle.


¶41] Had the men of all Ireland, from sea to sea, attacked 
the line of *Eóghan*, it would not have been so grievous for their 
soldiery as if the race of *Suibhne* alone were spoiling them.


¶42] Unkindly was it for the seed of *Suibhne* to levy 
the dues of *Fódla* from the race of noble Niall for the 
generous line of royal *Dálach*.




---

p.129


¶43] The seed of *Suibhne*, the noble seed of Niall, two 
vine-groves from a single root, fruit of one golden husk 
excelling all the wood, they have sustained the glory 
of the Gael.


¶44] They are called of the same stock, their pedigrees 
are the same, equal the nobility of their men, equal the 
patrimony of their fathers.


¶45] Did the spirited warriors of *Suibhne*'s seed but 
consider, no better is their claim to Tory yonder in the 
north, or to the calm, ancient stream of the Mourne.


¶46] Or to *Craobhruadh* of the children of Ross, or fair 
Carrickfergus, or to the green hills and bright lands of 
Dundalk.


¶47] No closer is Conn of the hundred fights, no nearer 
Niall son of *Eochaidh*, nor yet is spotless *Gaedheal* more 
akin to any other man than to Owen.


¶48] What should hinder Owen *Óg*, the Gaels' unique 
implement of battle, from following in the wake of Niall's 
seed of yore and taking hostages from the dewy hills 
of Bregia?


¶49] Empty houses around Croghan of Conn, from fear 
of the king of Conall's race; on MacSweeny the blame 
should lie—and castles by the Boyne are being wrecked.


¶50] What the daughter of Conn, son of the Calvach, 
gives to the poets—perpetual bestowing of treasure is 
an omen of praise—is a deprivation of which Margaret 
is none the worse.


¶51] Third generation from Conn, son of Conn, and from 
Manus, king of Conall's clan, though she be the most 
generous about riches what she does is nothing to boast 
of for her.


¶52] The kindreds of which she is, the wine-blood of Conall, the race of *Eóghan*—if she inherit their instincts—have 
hitherto been supreme amid the people of Niall's land.

MAC SWEENEY OF FANAD
--------------------


¶1] The counterpart of Allen is in Ulster, for victory
in battle, for wizardry; for defending the fair mansions 
of *Banbha*, for staying the rapine of Ireland.


¶2] For waging conflicts, for reddening blades, for music, 
for chessplaying; for seeking of killing and chasing, for 
desire of foray.


¶3] In the same guise as ever, Allen of the Field of 
the *Gailiain*, or its very likeness in a jewel of a firm 
house of stout masonry, is in Ulster.


¶4] Throughout Ireland, Isle of Bregia, away from the 
warriors of Leinster, until it reached Fanad of Ulster, 
Allen hath betaken itself.


¶5] The rampart which the *Fian* of *Fál* held is again in Rathmullan, or else a castle similar in structure to that 
ancient one of Allen.


¶6] There is in Fanad a likeness of soft-swarded Allen 
in its own guise; such as the warriors of Allen are in 
it, graceful, bright-weaponed, well-equipped stead.


¶7] Should it be that it is not Allen, this brilliant, marvellous 
rampart, this other dwelling is a fitting pledge 
for the bright house of *Fionn* of Allen.


¶8] Though it were difficult to excel that first Allen 
of the tribe of *Baoisgne*, this second Allen—castle 
with firm, stately towers—is better when looked on.


¶9] Greater is its muster of valiant heroes, more its 
youths, more its companies of women; more numerous 
around the long-lashed scion of *Murbhach* are poets 
visiting the mansion.




---

p.131


¶10] More numerous the variety of its musicians, its 
reciters of soothing tales, more numerous the royal 
host of light-hearted women, ever weaving diverse gilt 
broideries.


¶11] More numerous the cupbearers dispensing feasts, 
the children of kings sharing fetters, greater the 
distribution of the wealth of all in the castle rich in flocks
and gentle springs.


¶12] Nobler the household of the dwelling than the 
followers of *Fionn* of Allen; the pledge from the *Fionn* 
of old will go to the other *Fionn* of Ulster.


¶13] Thou, Donnell, kindly countenance, art that very 
*Fionn* from the land of Fanad—plain of limpid streams 
and stately rivers—protecting the men of Ulster.


¶14] No hardship or distress shall touch Tirconell of 
placid streams that thou art not bound to ward off 
from that country of untilled borders, of swanflocks.


¶15] As far as Moylurg on the other side, as far as 
the Finn, and to the shores of Tory, thou bright of cheek, 
it is thine to guard her bays and harbors.


¶16] Watching the couch when the king has lain down 
to rest, settling disputes, checking quarrels; going for 
him into battle on their behalf—the greater part of thine 
obligations I do not recount.


¶17] The rear in defeat, the van in an onslaught, thou, 
O lord of Fanad, dost form for the chiefs of Conall's 
glittering-bladed line in the country of the foe.


¶18] Therefore, Donnell, in the pleasant Land of *Flann*, 
bright with fair stems, ennumerable privileges are bestowed 
on thee by the seed of Conall.


¶19] Thou, gracious figure, art entitled to hold the 
kingship on the death of a high-king, until another king 
be found by whom she will be possessed.




---

p.132


¶20] Thou, gentle of eye, art entitled to be by O'Donnell's 
right elbow, that thou, O king, shouldst occupy it ennobles 
the place.


¶21] When thou art dubbed MacSweeny, thou modest 
of countenance, yet menacing, the robe of O'Donnell of 
Derry is given to thee, thou heavy-lashed, stately eye.


¶22] Thou, modest countenance, hast the right to keep 
a fugitive under protection in thy country for a year 
without compensation being sought for his deed.


¶23] A cow out of every holding, a swine from every 
herd, this is thy stipend for defending the province; a 
ripe stem from the midst of a garden, thou hast the crop
of every orchard.


¶24] The king of Conall's race may have sought to
exchange estates with thee, thou ruddy countenance, we 
know of thee that thou hast never attempted to barter.


¶25] Did the race of *Dálach* give thee two or three 
times as much as they give, more honor even than that 
hast thou earned from that race.


¶26] Thou art the favored offspring of *Dálach*'s seed, 
the pride of their annals, treasure-house for their-peoples, 
herdsman for safeguarding their triumphs.


¶27] Thou art the eyesight of the host of *Bearnas*, the 
steward of their lordship; thou art the fruit excelling 
beyond all the wood, which succoured the noble race of 
Conall.


¶28] Thou art their protecting shield on the field of 
danger, thou leviest the heavy tribute which their fathers 
exacted from Ireland, it is imposed in every spot.


¶29] Thou art the leader of *Suibhne*'s race, the *Fionn* 
of our Plain of Conall; it is thou that imitatest *Fionn*, 
thou king of whom *Aoibheall* told.


¶30] Many prophecies have we from the noble saints 
of Ireland about thy sleek, soft, yellow head, foretelling 
the *Fionn* of Fanad.




---

p.133


¶31] Colum at first foretold to Ulster, land of bright 
fruit-trees, what the *Fionn* of Fanad would accomplish 
for the fair plain of heavily laden woods.


¶32] He foretold that this man would so deal with 
Leinster, and the Peoples of Tara, that from kick of men 
meadows would go unmown throughout that Dwelling 
of *Tailte*.


¶33] Beyond any other tidings that *Séadna* revealed as a 
young and truthful babe did the impetuously-affirming 
youth tell of the long-haired *Fionn* of Fanad.


¶34] 'Grievous to me,' said the child, 'it has filled me 
with dejection, the slaughter that *Fionn* of the flowing 
tresses will inflict on your warriors, ye men of Leinster.'


¶35] 'In the land of Leinster—sorrow enough—this 
*Fionn* from Fanad will leave but women to till every 
soil;' even as Colum had spoken.


¶36] Thou art that *Fionn* from Fanad, it is to thee thine 
ancient rivals look to fulfil the prophecy, and banish the 
usurping race from Ushnagh.


¶37] Thou wilt make a slaughter of the Leinstermen, 
thou, graceful *(?)* of hand, wilt spread the hue of embers 
over the white houses of the foreigners; surely Colum 
will be believed.


¶38] Shortly, MacSweeny, wilt thou boast to the chieftain 
of our race of Conall the reaving of *Fódla* from end 
to end, and the banishment of the foreigners from Ireland.


¶39] Thou, son of Turlogh, hast given tokens worthy of 
credit that thou art come to-day as the prophesied 
one to reign over Fanad.


¶40] Allen of the fertile slopes of Leinster—thou, *Fionn* 
of Fanad, hast built the counterpart of its timber and its 
walls, the counterpart of Allen in Ulster.


¶41] A choice of the royal ladies of Ulster hast thou 
made, thou dark-lashed eye; happy the man who hath 
first taken her, happy he who made that choice.




---

p.134


¶42] A gentle eye, bright as crystal, hath the daughter 
of the king of Banagh; lips to which the hue of the 
berry might be likened, a glowing cheek that never was 
made to blush.


¶43] Every woman of Ulster would not suit the husband 
of *Gráinne* as a companion, none but a generous man 
would suit her, happy he of whom she is the mate.

p.135


INISHOWEN
---------


¶1] Speak on, thou castle of *Oileach*, many a thing 
must one ask of thee, thou fair, long-standing dwelling, 
regarding the warriors of Ireland.


¶2] Let us learn from thee, tell us, thou ancient, bright-lawned 
castle, of those who invaded Bregian *Banbha*, 
of the forays and seizures of the Gael.


¶3] Each thing of which I have knowledge will be got 
from me, hearken, what time were better to reveal it? 
downwards from the pouring of the Flood.


¶4] I know, as a rare branch of knowledge, of six seizures 
in turn after the Flood on the cool, moist, 
white-surfaced, dewy plain.


¶5] The coming of *Pártholón* from the land of Greece, 
and of the Sons of *Nemhedh*to the country of *Fál*, 
the third age of the world, it is I that best remember them.


¶6] How wast thou at first, thou lovely, changeful castle, 
when *Pártholón* of Bregia's haven had come to occupy 
the Field of the Gael?


¶7] Upon the coming of *Pártholón* I was enduring my 
misfortune in this land, with no enclosed meadow or 
stone rampart, but all an oaken thicket.


¶8] How was it with thee during the sovranty of the 
Children of *Nemhedh*, when thy form had been changed? 
Tell us, thou castle of limewashed [*...*]*(?)* walls.


¶9] I was a smooth plain, without thickets, without 
woods, the border slope of my bright, steed-haunted lea 
was a splendid mound of assembly.




---

p.136


¶10] Of my bending wood with its graceful fruit-trees 
not a root was left in the ground—small since that has 
been the growth of my noble forest—from the might 
of *Nemhedh*'s saintly race.


¶11] How long wast thou thus, a smooth, brightly 
glistening slope, without house or household, thou 
greens-swarded castle of *Oileach*?


¶12] Until the coming of the *Tuath Dé Danann* to the 
spreading woods of *Fódla*. I was, as such were unfitting 
for me, empty of house or dwelling.


¶13] Dost thou remember who were the first of the 
comely *Tuath Dé* who inhabited thee, thou tower amidst 
supple, flowering stems?


¶14] The Children of mighty, honey-mouthed *Cearmaid*, 
keen-weaponed warriors, a glistening band from the 
Bregian Boyne, were the first that entered into fellowship 
with me.


¶15] For my smooth, fertile hills the Children of *Cearmaid* 
forsook stately *Cathair Chröoinn*, hereditary citadel of 
the race.


¶16] A while after they had come to me the Sons of 
*Míl* of Spain wrested *Banbha* from the Children of *Cearmaid* without a division as profit of battle.


¶17] From that day to this the lords of *Míl*'s race, 
white-handed host, dealers of heavy blows, have been 
defending Ireland within me.


¶18] From that time on I have never lacked one high-king 
in succession to another, or a provincial chief who 
excelled any in Ireland's swan-necked plain.


¶19] From me five-and-twenty kings of *Róch's*, valiant, 
generous race seized the Dwelling of *Dá Thí*, thereby 
my dignity is ennobled.


¶20] And after the Faith there were crowned from me 
six-and-twenty kings of the blood of fair Conall, and of 
Niall's line, fruit from *(?)* each cluster were they.




---

p.137


¶21] Then was I held alternately by the noble kindreds 
of Niall's seed—a smooth [*...*]*(?)* plain with lofty stems, 
another Tara of the men of Ireland.


¶22] Since from thee all other tidings have been obtained, 
from the beginning until the end of time, thou fortress 
amidst pleasant, brown-surfaced hills, which company hast 
thou found the best?


¶23] The wondrous warriors from Ulster's soil, *Fiamhain*'s 
seed, the blood of *Dochartach*, that bright band are the 
best whom we have known from of yore.


¶24] O tapering tower of smooth, even walls, who is 
it that excels even amongst the lords of *Fiamhain*'s 
race, stems from [*...*][15](javascript:footNote('T402563/note015.html')) of Frewen?


¶25] Were we considering it forever, John son of Felim, 
of the clear soft eye fore which the sea is shallow, would 
be the choicest of *Fiamhain*'s fair stock.


¶26] O'Doherty of the castle of *Oileach*—why should 
it be asked?—rosy, bright-hued countenance, he is my 
one darling in his time.


¶27] Though *Fiamham*'s seed are the best of the noble 
stocks of Ireland, they are as stars about the full moon, 
John is the one choice of them all.


¶28] It is he that has most possessions, he is the one 
who bestows most gifts, in the benevolence of *Iomghán*'s, 
valorous scion there comes no ebb.


¶29] It is unlikely that any should attempt to surpass 
Felim's heir in his name for generosity; as a plain lies 
beneath a hill so is every other renown in comparison 
with his.


¶30] Considering the fruitfulness of his territory, the 
goodliness of his kingdom, why would he not do all 
that he does?—no man should marvel thereat.


¶31] 'The paradise of Ireland' is the name for that 
stretch of land which is his; never did eye behold a finer 
territory than the soil of its plains and hillocks.




---

p.138


¶32] From sea-locked Fanad to the bright streams of 
Loch Foyle, from Malin to the plain of *Bearta*, a lovely 
and most famous land.


¶33] Land where waves are gentlest, where granaries 
are loftiest, angelic country of shallow streams, 'Land of 
Promise' of the men of Ireland.


¶34] Well is it placed, between the sea and the woods, 
level strands beyond far-stretching plains, wondrous, 
fairy-like regions.


¶35] Smooth moors amidst its forests, peaked hills beyond 
the moors, a yellow-hazelled wood by the fair plain, a 
billowing sea as a hedge around it.


¶36] Good is this land [*...*][16](javascript:footNote('T402563/note016.html')), better is he who has custody
of it; alas, if one should see over any part of Ulster 
a king that did not surpass Ireland.


¶37] Were his the supremacy of Bregia's plain he would
spend it and defend it; if prosperity according to benevolence be just the lord of Fahan should be prosperous.


¶38] If the contents of his house are considered, and the number of his household—it is not a superfluity
which should be grudged to him—no superfluity *(?)* of
riches is found.


¶39] Thou man who proclaimest what the high-king of 
*Fiamhain*'s stock possesses, grudge it not to the princely 
hero of *Fál*, greater is his spending than his gains.


¶40] If many speak truth, did not the' house of *Oileach* 
fall to John, the thronged dwelling of O'Doherty would 
not be a shelter for any in Ulster.


¶41] This is the several statement of those who have 
journeyed the plains of *Banbha*—all the delight of Ireland 
would be found in the labyrinthine *(?)* four-towered court.


¶42] Since Tara received *Ruadhán*'s interdiction against 
the men of *Fál*, the lords of Conn's land have dwelt in 
the pleasant, fairy-like, comely castle.

p.139


CORMAC AND BRIAN O'HARA
-----------------------


¶1] The repute of two is as a wood to each of them; 
they spare not to dispense their cattle; two fruitful branches 
of a fragrant forest, scions are they who have earned 
homage.


¶2] Two full moons of *Leath Mogha*, *Cian*'s two sons 
that never purchased peace; two palm-branches of the 
regal stock, choice ones of whom it is not apparent that 
either should be rejected.


¶3] Though the rewards of the first man were something 
to boast of, greater are the bounties that follow; until 
a poet obtained the wealth of Cormac, he glorified the #
gifts of Brian.


¶4] Long is it remembered by *Lughaidh*'s Country that
the seed of *Cian* are no peaceable folk; either of them in 
ungentle mood was care enough for a land.


¶5] Whatever fight in which Cormac is is not believed 
to be wanting in forces; if he lacks a man he finds one 
in the house that is entered.


¶6] If a poet were leaving Cormac he would be coming 
to Brian; the company that did not depart from him last 
night will return as a fresh company to-night.


¶7] If it be that they avoid the rest of the seed of Eber 
that is no reproach to the excellent warriors, a pursuing 
party that has looked upon the children of *Cian* will 
not overtake even the most slowly-stepping women.


¶8] When Cormac joined the race of *Lughaidh* few 
believed that Brian would flinch, how many of the seed 
of *Sadhbh* abstained*(?)* from the conflict the number that 
were in the battle know not.




---

p.140


¶9] Through terror of Cormac under the shelter of night, 
through dread of Brian coming after him—they are both 
hidden by the hand of the foe—the grassy stalks have 
bent back.


¶10] As for spoils taken from the enemy, Cormac considered 
that what was in his keeping was not his own; 
only until a poet is seen does the hoarding of cattle 
trouble the race of *Cian*.


¶11] The gifts which Cormac keeps for travellers failed 
him at last; the guest is satisfied after his discontent, 
Brian's wealth hath made him so*(?)*


¶12] Oft of yore, in contending for the kingship of 
Leyney, has he sought his spears in the midst of slumber;
he used to close the gates of his eyes when daylight 
came to his fastness.


¶13] *Ú*'s son hath a bevy of warriors, of the hawk-like
birds of the seed of *Blod*; in order to test the soldiery
of *Tulach* in battle Brian allows a superiority over them.


¶14] Cormac only undertakes to get justice; Brian knows 
not contentment with justice, seizing a shield wrought 
with golden monsters, he seeks to levy claims which are 
not got.


¶15] No great regard had he for ancestral right*(?)* until 
she favored thee, Cormac; suffer poets to feast beside 
thee, that is an honor of which Brian thinks much.


¶16] Let those poets, too, be mentioned at the sewing of 
satin banners—it is difficult to abate the discontent 
of companies—utterances with the art*(?)* of gold rings.


¶17] Thou, Cormac, causing him to be forgotten, that 
is what his hindered the bestowal of her love; the woman 
who has sought thy companionship would not 
exchange Brian for any other man.


¶18] A word from thee is enough for a man, after that 
little doth he reck what place thou choose *(?)*; a shattered 
flag of ice hath convicted thee of the foray.




---

p.141


¶19] People of means *(?)* after their discontent, if they 
rely on thee worthy is the support; all that the soldiery 
fear is lest their own king should wreck a tower.


¶20] Thou, Cormac, ruling a country, hath kept Brian 
from conquering it; thy stewards go beyond their limits 
to increase the liberties *(?)* of the kindred of *Cian*.


¶21] The warriors of *Banbha*'s isle are in fault that they 
knew not the manner of thy weapons; a lance which thou 
didst ply against them as a dart fitted the spearshafts 
of the rest.


¶22] From the shafts of thy javelins, after a space, 
there springs a wood from a champion's grave; so that 
it were the easier for thy attacker to wound thee, thou 
didst send such a number of weapons into him.


¶23] She gave her love in turn to the children of *Cian* 
of the glowing spears; the maiden looked on thee after 
him so that she was ready to chose another than Brian.


¶24] Amongst the great drinking-horns of another castle
they must needs divide its measure, the head of thy spear,
when its shaft is removed, excels the goblets of thy dwelling.


¶25] Thou hast for poets, Cormac, an entertainment
which is a cause of fame; in store for a passing guest
thou keepest *(but)* a grass-green stream.


¶26] None the better does he like an attack in battle, 
since thou hast the supremacy in power; had Brian 
a longer cast he would not take the field of battle 
against thee.


¶27] Without its being red hot, without entering a forge, 
a feat none else ever could perform, thou wilt 
straighten—or it will break in pieces—a shoe [*...*]*(?)* that never was 
worn by a horse.


¶28] It is he that first incurs the obligation, it were 
better for the lips to be silent, any king that reproached 
thee for thy slayings denies it, or seeks honorprice.


¶29] Thou, Cormac, art celebrated by those who travel
the three continents; the schools are not accustomed to
thy going into obscurity, they do not seek thee there.




---

p.142


¶30] The warmth of the early spring joins the branches 
of great trees to the roots of the sward; the fruits bend 
the trees so low that there would not be safety on top 
for the bird's nest.


¶31] Bending woods and shallow pools, sweet springs 
over pasture plains, honey [*...*]*(?)* tincturing green streams 
from the earth throughout an hour *(?)*


¶32] Scarcely is there anything to equal it in the days 
of Cormac, save the wondrous *(?)* havens of Paradise; what 
he drank of the waters of Leyney's plains takes from 
the child the remembrance of the breast.


¶33] The heavy tribute which Cormac gathered did not 
protect the land of the reaver; Brian thought his share 
of the settlement too small, he knew what it was before 
going on foray.


¶34] Gold is not lasting with the warriors of Cashel
amidst the sparkling of hot ales; such fumes arose from 
the goblet around Cormac that brown mantles smouldered.


¶35] Lion's whelp of *Leath Mogha*, fortunate salmon of 
the race of *Cian*; whatever place he was in yester-eve 
he is enough as a guard for it to-night.


¶36] To a chosen soldiery who have followed them it 
would not profit to oppose them—the race of *Sadhbh* is 
not a fence without a top-rail, they fight to, uphold 
Cormac's peace.


¶37] Her gray eyes flash crimson so that she cannot 
conceal her passion, because of him a woman can scarcely 
sleep, the branch of *Deirc* has confessed it.


¶38] For the castle of the champion of Leyney there 
is no danger that the complement of any house will excel 
it; all the mighty progeny of Eber the Fair arose from 
feasting along with our Cormac.


¶39] The spear-forest of Eber's race, scarcely is there 
a fruit that they have not won; it is not possible to rival 
them in battle, trees above the woods are they.

p.143


CORMAC O'HARA
-------------


¶1] Here is the guarantee, Cormac, take this hand in 
thy supple grasp, knit this heart to thine, thou forest 
tree of *Bóromha*'s shore.


¶2] Take this body upon thine own, thou chief of royal
*Cian*'s race, against the law of the king of the bright 
isle of the English, let this life be guaranteed by thy life.


¶3] Accept me, upon thy mercy and thine honor, against 
both friend and enemy—O hand that rulest the race of 
Conn—thou art capable of protecting me.


¶4] Do not leave me to contend alone with any, thou 
kindly, royal presence, since thou, O bright cheek, art our 
one friend amongst the lean-bodied host of Teltown.


¶5] In short, thou grandson of *Onóra*, that thou be 
with me in a rightful cause is no benefit from thy rosy 
countenance if thou do not also support me in wrong.


¶6] I am continually in the jaws of danger, because of 
all the gossip that has been made about me, having no 
one. to protect me, unless thou canst undertake it.


¶7] To-day new laws are being imposed on the Sons of 
*Míl* by the noble, bright-handed English host, 
through-out the green-maned land of Frewen.


¶8] They summon the territories to them, and require 
from all in general, until they arc all ascertained *(?)*, a 
knowledge of every man, and of his native place.


¶9] Having assembled the territories the English of 
Eremon's Field write the names of their hosts, one after 
another, in a large, clean roll of parchment.

p.144


¶10] And when they have been assembled before them, 
each of the men of Ireland, thou warrior of *Tál*'s Dwelling, 
with manly following, must acknowledge an overlord.


¶11] They require that everyone under-heaven have a 
guarantor, or else—piteous the strait which has been 
wrought for them—die forthwith.


¶12] In brief, thou king of Leyney, on thee I set my 
security, in all my days, as is meet, thy book shall be 
my book.


¶13] Not because my inclination is towards thee, or 
because I am thy poet, thou fruit of *Eaghra*s cluster, 
do I choose thee as lord.


¶14] For this have I chosen to be with thee, thou royal 
star of Cashel's plain, both Gaels and English have agreed 
to give thee the title of righteous king.


¶15] Because thou art full of kindness and generosity, 
righteous and prudent—plentiful reasons for goodwill 
towards thee—therefore art thou loved, Cormac.


¶16] In thine own books, thou high-king of noble *Cian* 's 
line, under the knot that has never been loosened by 
me, let the name of each of us poets be written.


¶17] Let the name of every man of my kindred, mine own 
name in particular, thou precious treasure from the ancient 
plain of *Tál*, be kept in those books.


¶18] Be thy gentle eye assured, since I have thine 
affection, thou strong-aled scion from the waters of Duff,
that I shall merit it from thee.


¶19] I call thyself as witness to it if I live for the space
of a year during which thy love towards me will not be 
beneficial to me or to thee.


¶20] I shall compose for thee the artistic, well-wrought 
lay, the laboriously wrought *(?)* poem, and another time 
the single stanza, thou noble chief of *Bóromha*'s shore.




---

p.145


¶21] I shall give thee, as is due, knowledge of thy 
genealogical branches, of the tribute taken by thy forbears 
from the plains of Ireland, the course of their triumphs and 
their exploits.


¶22] I shall tell thee, thou slender form, of thy nobility 
transcending that of the rest of the men of Ireland, and 
of every homage that were due to thee—the price of 
our friendship, Cormac.


¶23] In order to raise the envy of the rest, to thee, 
thou son of *Úna*, I shall devote the best portion of my 
poesy, and the best part of my converse.


¶24] In requital thereof, thou chief of Cashel, it is not 
too much for me that thou offer thy life and body on 
my behalf if I be captured.


¶25] Even were one on trial for his life in a courthouse, 
while depending on thy honor neither he nor thou need 
tremble; here, Cormac, is the guarantee.


¶26] Undertake my protection, Mary, on behalf of the 
chieftain of bright Galey, thou fruitful scion of *Suibhne*'s 
race, whose safeguard is not in danger of violation.


¶27] O Mary, daughter of *Maol Muire* , until I entrusted 
to thee my shepherding, almost every fastness which I 
reached was forced, thou lady of clinging tresses.

CORMAC O'HARA
-------------


¶1] A good merchant is Cormac, *Cian*'s son for whom 
the yew-branch bends; a generous hand in bestowing 
cattle, the best barterer amongst you.


¶2] In Cormac's days never is anyone heard to cheat 
him in bargaining, that is what makes him of the pleasant, 
affable countenance easy to beguile.


¶3] *Cian*'s son, he of hardy achievements, the better 
bargainer is he—beloved hero from Bregia's hills—that 
each one coaxes him.


¶4] Behold is there any better exchange than the lasting, 
enduring honor that goes to the pleasant, kindly chieftain 
in return for vain, transitory wealth?


¶5] Not for long would the riches given by Fermoyle's 
lord remain, but the praises of his noble, ruddy 
countenance shall endure eternally.


¶6] None of the goblets or cloaks which all receive 
from Cormac, nor the [*...*]*(?)* engraved battle-weapon 
would endure for even a single thousand years.


¶7] Neither armour nor horse nor shining, carven helmet, 
nor tunic of soft, blue, sheeny satin, nor valued 
drinking-cup of variously wrought gold would endure.


¶8] If the wealth of the world were estimated—this is 
the gist of what ye have heard—save praise alone, there 
is naught of the earth but [*...*]*(?)*


¶9] A good merchant is he who exchanged the ephemeral 
flower that awakens envy—far from the flower is the 
coming of its fruit—for lasting encomium.




---

p.147


¶10] A good merchant is he who got in return for a 
worthless, transitory figment the sinccrest of fragrant, 
lasting panegyric at a time when art was being rejected.


¶11] A good merchant is he that purchases when the 
discount is greatest the goods on which he depends, 
or those which he must buy.


¶12] It was for O'Hara, by virtue of his ancestry—unniggardly 
men of no mean figure—to purchase the fine 
panegyrics of everyone.


¶13] Cormac son of *Cian* would never find—the more 
fitting that poesy should be fully requited—a time in 
which the stately poems he buys from all would be 
cheaper than now.


¶14] Throughout *Banbha*, of the nobles of Bregia's soft, 
dewy plain, this warrior alone is seeking poetry from 
us now.


¶15] A hundred times as much as what could be got 
to-day for polished specimens of the poet's art shall be 
given for them later on by the hero of *Bóromha*'s, shore.


¶16] When it is cheapest and when fewest are seeking 
it, that is the very time to cherish the flower of perfect, 
durably formed poetry.


¶17] Since poetry is cheap to-day, Cormac, if the prophesied 
one of *Crotta*'s Plain survive, will have an 
unreckon-able store of the eulogies of all.


¶18] The rover of the hills of Bregia will leave provision 
for all, gathered when easiest to obtain, of the polished 
offerings of the poets.


¶19] Good was that man of yore, the mighty, valorous 
hero of Cashel, who, away in the beginning of time, made 
just such a provision.


¶20] Famous *Mugh Néid*, Cormac's gallant, princely 
ancestor, king of *Codhal*'s strong-aled Plain, made a similar 
provision.




---

p.148


¶21] The queen of keen *Mugh Néid* beheld long ago 
a vision; there was import in the telling of it, she related 
it to the high-king.


¶22] Seven goodly, thriving cows appeared to that wife 
of *Mugh*, she sees the bright, sleek, fair herd around 
the isle of Ireland.


¶23] And then, moreover, it appeared to her that from 
the bright, wondrous herd each fair, rosy, white-hazelled 
plain was flowing with new milk.


¶24] After that herd there appeared to her seven hideous 
cows, sickening to speak of were the aged, spectral kine.


¶25] With harsh, bitter cries, with ironlike horns; furious 
as a [*...*]*(?)* flock; with sunken, burning eyes.


¶26] Not a trace of the young and marvellous herd 
was left by the frenzied, pugnacious, repulsive, venomous, 
serpentlike drove.


¶27] *Dearg Damhsa*, the king's druid, gave the reading 
of the dream, this is the truth thereof; he hearkened to 
the learned judgment, its great profit came to pass.


¶28] Thus said the druid, beginning: 'The first seven 
cows are seven years of abundant milk, perfect in rule 
and sovranty.'


¶29] 'The other cows, moreover, are seven miserable 
years of hardship, for Ireland, land of sweetly-murmuring 
waters, it will be a portent of devastation.'


¶30] 'The woman shall devour the son she carries on 
her back, the heir shall deny the father, throughout Ireland, 
smooth, beautiful land of blue streams, from hunger.'


¶31] 'Therefore,' said *Dearg Damhsa*, 'let provision be 
made by you ere the first years come to a close, thou 
bright-limbed king of the Gaels.'


¶32] 'In thy tax or thy tribute from proud *Leath Mogha* 
accept not throughout the spreading land of fair, fertile, 
dewy hills one penny of gold or of silver.'




---

p.149


¶33] 'Do not accept from any in thy royal tribute,'
said the king's sage, 'aught else save food as the universal 
payment.'


¶34] To each thing the druid said to him the king of *Áine*'s 
brightly-spreading land willingly agreed, he was of one mind with the sage.


¶35] Upon their own summons the Munstermen unanimously 
attend the son of the high-king, in an ordered 
multitude around Glandore, in return for aiding their 
distress.


¶36] *Conaire Mór* and *Maicnia* did homage to *Eóghan Mór*, after the assembling of the territories, most willing *(?)* 
were the host to submit to him.


¶37] *Mugh Néid* was over Munster as a lofty stem among saplings, by reason of his perpetual purchasing of food for the comely assembly of Munstermen.


¶38] The better are his seed ever since that he waited 
not for the time of high prices, he—bright form before 
which the sea ebbs—purchased the cheap bargains of 
the rest.


¶39] The high-king Cormac O'Hara imitates *Mugh Néid*
—two rightful owners of *Fál*'s Cornfield are they—in 
getting a profitable bargain from us.


¶40] *Cian*'s son who never defended a wrongful deed, 
it is right that he should be set to merchantry; flower of 
the stock of *Sadhbh*'s noble blood, a trafficker in the gold 
of poesy.


¶41] Here is a propitious bargain of perfect work of 
proven poets for his keen, eager, heavy-lashed eye, from 
the learned of Eber's Land.


¶42] Till the Day of Doom all that he has purchased
of the gold of poesy will remain as an augmentation of
fortune and prosperity for the host from *Bladhma*'s peaks.

p.150


¶43] The meeter is the time he hath thought to requite 
the poetic faculty of Laoghaire's Land since the regard 
of everyone else hath forsaken it; it is a flock without a 
shepherd.


¶44] The blessing of the poets of Innisfail, the united 
blessing of the holy men of Ireland; that is the requital 
of his purchase; blessed is he by whom it is earned.


¶45] On *Cian*'s son who buys encomiums the fortune 
of the blessing hath settled, from the sole of his soft, 
smooth, gracious foot to his thickly-curled, stately head.


¶46] Not more to-day than when he was a child is the 
love of all for his kindly features; the flower of Leyney 
got as a babe fortune which shall not be denied him.


¶47] Some time in his boyhood he was left as a child, 
after his kinsfolk had been cut off, ere his bright cheek 
had reached maturity.


¶48] No trusty friend or comrade had the slender-weaponed 
youth; he was in peril from his enemies, facing 
them alone.


¶49] His territory, and moreover his kinsmen, had been 
wrested from him, so that the builder of *Tál's* Dwelling 
was left as the only one of his kindred.


¶50] Then was the ownership of Leyney wrested from 
him—unkindness enough!—the unrightful man 
was elevated, and he for a time was outlawed.


¶51] Twenty-one years the man spent, during which 
neither younger nor elder of *Cian*'s seed settled in their 
homes, till he himself occupied the land.


¶52] The race of Blod entered into their old fortune[17](javascript:footNote('T402563/note017.html')) when Cormac's wrath had run its course, so that the race of 
*Cian* were brought in, and obtained their own award.


¶53] Full moon of the south—none the less did the 
noble young scion obtain kingship for being left as the 
single man of a kindred.




---

p.151


¶54] None overcame him; it seemed as if those who 
were plundering the race of Eber against the man were 
on his side.


¶55] It was more than fortune *(?)* for the lord of Leyney 
to obtain the tribute of the blue-surfaced land, after the 
champions from *Tál*'s Dwelling, in despite of everyone.


¶56] Never before, either here or in Munster of *Maicnia*, 
did God grant such fortune as this king's to any of 
*Dergthene*'s populous seed.


¶57] Pre-eminent fortune, choiceness of form, did the 
bright-toothed hero of Bregia's castle obtain in the day 
of his birth; the best of the Lord's first gifts.


¶58] Cormac's beauty was obtained from the Lord, both 
as regards form and eloquence; from the dear heart to 
the ruddy countenance are according to the will of Him 
who ordained them.


¶59] From the sole of his foot to his bright, curly head, 
there is not one member of the lord of *Gáirighe*'s fair 
host without some special endowment.


¶60] The gift of agility hath the soft, white foot, of
which invaders will be wary; triumph in every activity
hath the white hand, a palm that is gentle save in conflict.


¶61] The gift of speech have the crimson lips that bring 
discontent to women; the gift of intelligence hath the 
sprightly heart of the spouse of *Maiste*'s Plain.


¶62] From God above he hath excellence of truth and 
constancy; in the houses of election he hath triumphed 
in generosity and prowess.

CORMAC O'HARA
-------------


¶1] Do you wish for the history of the seed of *Cian*, 
until they are traced to a single root? For the bright 
race of Eber the Fair one must do the utmost.


¶2] Or do you desire that from the spring of knowledge 
I have found there should be emitted a pure stream of 
recondite poetry about the affinities of the champion of 
Munster?


¶3] He was acknowledged as the best of the band, the 
Eber from whom they are sprung; another such as the 
torch of Bregia's castle was not amongst the Children 
of *Míl*.


¶4] There never was one to equal Eber the Fair in Spain 
or in Ireland, of the royal blood of his tribe, of the seed 
of *Bile* or *Breóghan*.


¶5] With him those sons of *Míl* of Spain came to 
the land of *Fál*; Eber was their senior, from across the ocean 
he conquered the Plain of *Té*.


¶6] Four sons of Eber the Fair gained the headship 
of Ireland; match of those four never sprang from the 
active, steadfast race of *Míl*.


¶7] Thereafter they all perished, save great *Conmhaol*, 
son of Eber, leaving no children in their places, the 
youthful, celebrated band.


¶8] *Conmhaol*, son of Eber of the steeds, the first king 
of the Munster warriors for whom a dwelling was prepared 
in Tara, a man about whom maidens were envious.


¶9] From *Conmhaol* to Brian of the horns there are of 
his kinsfolk thirty kings in succession in the regal list, 
reigning over the land of Ireland.


¶153] 


¶10] Thirty-eight of the line of Eber, son of *Míl*, ruled 
the stately, white-walled castle of Trim down to the time 
of *Oilill Ólum*.


¶11] From *Oilill*, son of *Eóghan Mógr*, back to Eber of the red-gold weapons, Bregia's host—mild and noble of heart—were a single kindred.


¶12] The triumphant race of Eber the Fair divide then 
at *Oilill*—a thing which increased their mettle *(?)*—in 
three genealogical branches.


¶13] Nineteen sons are reckoned as the family of *Oilill 
Ólum*, and if you trace them there are only the descendants 
of three to be enumerated.


¶14] Fortunate he who had the three sons, *Eóghan*, *Cian* and Cormac; three fathers of the men of *Eamhain*, bright 
stalks of the vine-woods.


¶15] The line of *Eóghan*, which never refused combat, 
the race of *Carthach* in each of its species, there is much 
one need not trace, and the subordinate branches of the tribes of *Carthach*.


¶16] Cormac, son of red-weaponed *Oilill*, is the ancestor 
of the seed of Brian, north and south; children of one 
father are the blood of *Cas*, heritors of the grassy 
meadow of the Fergus.


¶17] Smooth-haired *Cian*, son of *Oilill*, was *Oilill*'s youngest son; he deserves the pledges of the rest, a 
younger son to whom respect is due.


¶18] Never heard I of any to equal the progeny of *Cian*, 
son of *Oilill Ólum*; smooth-palmed warriors for whom 
the forest stooped, battle-props of the Gael.


¶19] Seventeen sons had valorous *Cian*, but none of 
his children occupied his patrimony save one, noble stem 
of a fragrant wood.


¶20] Tadhg, son of *Cian*, who never grudged cattle—
from Tadhg are derived the kings over the long-grassed 
Plain of the Fair, and many of the patron saints of Ireland.




---

p.154


¶21] It was *Tadhg* himself who obtained the three 
*Luighne* from the king of Tara in battle; and not for 
gold, or in exchange for cattle, but as the price of shedding 
his blood.


¶22] The two sons of *Tadhg* of the beaked ships, *Connla* 
and Cormac *Gaileangach*, they are the two from whom the 
race of *Cian* sprang, two royal husks of kindred trees.


¶23] Descendants of *Connla*, son of *Tadhg*, are the seed 
of *Cearbhall*, of the smooth, vast plain, and—heavily 
fruited wood of crimson trees—the descendants of *Conchobhar* of *Cianacht*.


¶24] The host of Leyney, who never shrank from combat, 
are the descendants of Cormac *Gaileangach*; men steady 
in step towards spear-points, choice golden stems of Ireland.


¶25] Cormac *Gaileangach* took the land from the Plain of 
Mar to *Magh Tuireadh*; he had all the territory from 
Slievemurry to the Plain of Mar.


¶26] The same Cormac took from Loch *Laoigh* to Loch 
Corrib; from the east bank of Corrib he paused not until 
he reached the flowing Boyle.


¶27] One son was the offspring of Cormac, named *Laoi*, 
the long-handed; the son desisted not in his valor until 
he gained the inheritance of his father.


¶28] Two sons had *Laoi*, of the keen blades, nobly-born 
*Nia Corb*, and *Seisgnéan*; peaceful scions from the rushing 
Moy, two royal heirs of the plain of Cashel.


¶29] One son had *Nia Corb of the battles*, named Art, 
the warrior of Tara; for twenty years did the man rule 
the hostages of the Gael.


¶30] For nineteen years after him was his son over his 
race; a king like Art was fair *Fiodhchuire*, for whom 
the cornfield of the *Gaileanga* was more fertile.


¶31] For twenty-one years *Figheann*, son of *Fiodhchuire*, 
reigned; the land in which he was he held for a time 
as king without opposition.




---

p.155


¶32] Over the country of Leyney from end to end *Nad 
Fraoich*, son of *Figheann*, followed for twelve years, it 
is said, the order of his genealogical branches.


¶33] *Bréanainn*, son of *Nad Fraoich* of the feasts, reigned 
as a king worthy of homage for a year and a day without belying his promise *(?)*, according to the testimony of the learned.


¶34] *Fionnbharr*, son of *Bréanainn*, the archbishop, the 
high-king—the territories are sufficient witness—reigned 
thirty years.


¶35] Great *Diarmuid*, son of *Fionnbharr*, held the country 
of Leyney, land of glowing countrysides—the best of all 
reigns was the period of this clmmpion—for six years without peril.


¶36] For twenty years *Ceann Faoladh* held the kingship, 
north and south; the wind of possession of the fair land 
was his, *Diarmuid*'s, generous heir.


¶37] *Taichleach*[18](javascript:footNote('T402563/note018.html')), son of *Ceann Faoladh*, held the kingship 
of the pleasant land of Leyney—far extended is
the time *(?)* of his fame—for twenty years without a break.


¶38] *Flaithgheas*, strong son of *Taichleach*, held Leyney 
of the bright gardens for—he neither lessened it nor 
increased it—the same length of time as did his father.


¶39] The door of no homestead was closed in the reign 
of *Béac*, generous son of *Flaithgheas*; for a hundred 
years he protected the churches, ruling over the blue 
lands of the *Gaileanga*.


¶40] *Saorghus*, son of *Béac*, of the golden horns, was 
made king by the others forthwith; for a year and a 
half the noble champion of *Modharn* ruled over Leyney.


¶41] *Eaghra*, son of *Saorghus*—it was most easy for him—held the crimson plain of Leyney for ten years in 
full rule and kingship.


¶42] *Maghnus*, son of *Eaghra*—alas for the land whose 
lord he was—attempted to take possession of the territories 
in despite of *Eaghra* his father.




---

p.156


¶43] *Eaghra* of the green-edged weapons laid his curse 
upon *Maghnus*; he enjoyed the territory but for one 
day's space, he perished *(?)* ere he gained it.


¶44] For one hundred years afterwards, throughout 
three generations, they were without the title of royal 
heir, without a king, from the bursting forth of reaving 
and war.


¶45] Until *Aodh* of the plaited locks, son of *Taichleach*, son of *Muircheartach*, son of great *Domhnall*, son of 
*Maghnus*, took command of the host of the blue, green land.


¶46] For two and twenty years *Aodh* reigned over the 
fair slopes of Leyney; a clear-minded king worthy of 
pledges, ruling all in general.


¶47] Then *Conchobhar*, son of *Aodh*, most fearless king 
under heaven, face like a glowing ember, ruled Leyney 
but three quarters of a year.


¶48] It is said his rule over Leyney lasted but half a 
year—*Aodh* son of warlike *Conchobhar*, noble, 
heavily-fruitful scion of Tara.


¶49] For three score years *Diarmuid*, son of *Aodh*, the 
high-king, a king not faint-hearted before plundering-parties, 
reigned over the warriors of Leyney.


¶50] The son of *Diarmuid* of the generous gifts, the 
king named Art of the Horses—for four royal years the 
descendants of *Cian* were ruled by him of the bright, 
ever-radiant locks.


¶51] For twenty years in succession Art, father of 
*Domhnall*, left the kingship of the blue-brown, fertile 
plain in charge of fair *Domhnall* the Cleric.


¶52] *Seaán Mór*, the second son, obtained Art's inheritance 
without change *(?)*—enough was it as a king's 
rule—for twelve years without weakness.


¶53] Thirty-eight years he obtained—*Fearghal*, son of 
noble, loveable *Domhnall*, sincere heart which presaged 
affection, gained this land.




---

p.157


¶54] *Tadhg*, son of *Fearghal*, prince of the schools, for 
forty years ruled the bright, spreading plain of Leyney, 
restful land of ancient, warm rivers.


¶55] *Seaán* the swarthy, son of *Tadhg*, leader of the 
warriors, had—little enough for his bright cheek—the 
same period as his father.


¶56] For twenty years and twice nine, it is said, thus 
the extent of his rule when ascertained, *Tomaltach*, noble 
son of *Seaán*, reigned over the rest.


¶57] For five years at least *Muirchertach*, the other 
son, defended the bright slopes of Leyney, a task most 
difficult to perform.


¶58] The seed of *Cian* submitted to Cormac for 
twenty-nine years; strong, valorous scion, generous son of 
*Tomaltach*.


¶59] Neither *Ruaidhrí* nor his son *Maghnus* was called 
king, although they had the obedience of the men of 
Munster, for fear of wronging their seniors.


¶60] For eight years and five *Oilill*, son of *Maghnus*, a 
righteous king without violence, without treachery, held 
the kingship of all the territories.


¶61] For eleven years east and west the host of Leyney's 
crimson plain, companies who were no likely mark for 
hardihood, were in the power of *Seaán*, son of William.


¶62] *Cian*, son of *Oilill*, who never refused guests, did 
not wait to get his estate; when their lord perished the 
line of Cormac were not ready for action.


¶63] The period of *Tadhg*, son of valiant *Cian*, was four 
flowery years; a full moon causing most fruitful strands 
was the chieftain-tree from the plain of *Collán*.


¶64] For eighteen years then it was in the power of 
Conn son of *Ruaidhrí*; he held the land without a rival, 
save that it was in peril.




---

p.158


¶65] After a space Cormac, son of *Cian*, son of *Oilill*, 
is made king by the rest; he takes possession in place 
of his forefathers, by the voices of English and Gaels.


¶66] He settles the land of Leyney, both as 
regards laity and church; the fragrant country with its fair vestures 
of soil Cormac apportions generally.


¶67] He settles in their own place all the assemblies 
of noble *Cian*'s line; wrongs are repealed, strongholds 
are erected.


¶68] The dues of his kindred he will levy on friends and 
enemies; the valor of the battle-lion of *Cian*'s blood 
has revived the fame of his race.


¶69] He gathers their books to discover their genealogical 
branches; every recondite matter concerning his stock 
he seeks in the regnal list.


¶70] The ancient charter of tributes of the plain of Leyney 
having fallen out of remembrance, it is renewed for his 
heirs, so that it is a bright, clear charter.


¶71] Many claims upon his own territory has the chief of 
royal *Cian*'s tribe; it is just that he, noble, fierce 
countenance, should obtain a spell of the patrimony.


¶72] Almost has it become prescriptive—for nine hundred 
and four years Leyney has been under the tribe of *Cian*, 
companies who never deserved reproach.


¶73] By means of battle and war was gained the land 
they have got—it were little but grievous to oppose
them—and with the will of the high-kings of Ireland.


¶74] Claim enough for Cormac, did all consider it 
forthwith, are the troubles he met concerning it, armed, 
red weaponed hero.


¶75] A good charter on the land of his forefathers is 
the evil he suffered from childhood's years, shedding his 
blood on its behalf, till he displayed the fame of his exploits.




---

p.159


¶76] Leyney's territory, of glowing slopes, lay neath a 
covering of thievery and rapine, until he—the greatest 
war he ever waged—came to her help.


¶77] From that time on she has been a restful, fairylike 
plain; without pain, without enmity, without wrath, 
without desire of plundering or conflict.


¶78] The hand which had harmed repaired the land of 
Leyney in the days of Cormac; it is a land from which a
veil hath rolled away, in one day it was settled.


¶79] Never has there been of his true race from *Tadhg*, 
son of *Cian*, to the son of *Úna*—the fame of his 
forefathers he has inherited from the warriors—a man 
comparable to Cormac.


¶80] The seed of *Cian* were in grievous perplexity, as 
ye have heard, until there sprang up the forest-tree from 
the Dwelling of *Tál*, who gives life to his kinsfolk.


¶81] The wooing was the beginning of fortune *(?)*[19](javascript:footNote('T402563/note019.html')), *Cian*'s 
son, as the heir of a high chief, found in his hour of 
wretchedness the first mate he loved.


¶82] Mary, daughter of *Maol Muire*; regal in aspect, 
chaste in mind; a woman excelling those of Bregia's 
dewy castle, the favorite of all of her kindred.


¶83] Cormac son of *Cian* has got, if she be estimated 
in every particular—our choice of all her stock—the best 
of mates to love.


¶84] Those who preceded her of her line have fame as 
their inheritance, it is likely that she will possess the 
inheritance, rather than all the women of the ancient line 
of *Suibhne*.

A PRECIOUS WEAPON
-----------------


¶1] Welcome art thou, fierce *Gráinne*! No ill case his 
who should depend on thee as his only weapon, thou shining one with the hue of ruddy drops *(?)*, 
well-omened, keen-edged, perilous.


¶2] Thou surpassing jewel of a dagger; thou venomous, 
inimical monster; thou form so harsh yet most smooth, 
dark and graceful; thou veritable queen amongst the 
weapons of Ireland.


¶3] Thou fierce, hacking bear; thou best of all iron; 
thou bright-looped, swarthy tribal treasure; thou disturber 
of the hearts of champions.


¶4] Thou point that cannot be withstood; thou darling 
of high-kings; thou black opening of the great door, 
thou light of even before dark.


¶5] Thou slitting of the thread of life; thou high-king 
amongst weapons of all kinds; thou cause of envy in the 
heart; treasure of the eye of multitudes.


¶6] Thou gracefully shaped bar of steel; never did thy 
opponent in battle bear tidings from the conflict in which 
ye met, nor shall one ever do so.


¶7] Even the testament *(?)* in short, though the fee for 
leeching be small—great reproach doth it bring to thy 
bright form—is not procured for thy victims *(?)*.


¶8] Never did any on earth experience a bad year 
from thy fortune, thou brightly-blossomed, comely sun.


¶9] It was a happy omen whereby thou didst fall to 
*Aodh Óg*, son of this *Aodh*, to a royal heir of Conn's race; a meet comrade for thee.




---

p.161


¶10] Thou art such a precious treasure as sufficeth him, 
thou seasoned, keen, cool weapon, and he, the youth from 
Bregia's battlesome castle, is the one sufficing surety 
for thee.


¶11] Oft, as a pledge of much wealth, hast thou been 
lifted from the smooth, comely knee of Maeve's descendant, 
at the quaffing of the juice of the vine-fruit.


¶12] Oft, it is said, as stipend of a high-king's heir, did 
the salmon from the fertile, murmuring Boyne get much 
gold and silver by thy means.


¶13] Oft hath a hundred of each kind of cattle been 
readily got through thee by *Aodh* for the poets of 
*Crioinhthann*'s line, to uphold the repute of the stately, 
heavy-lashed one.


¶14] Never was it expected, thou shining one that hast 
not suffered hurt, that the scion from ancient *Aolmhagh*'s 
slender streams would forego thee for the excellent 
weapons of any of the men of Ireland.


¶15] None of the men of the world could obtain thee 
from the white-toothed, graceful one—bright palm to 
which one must needs yield homage—save some man 
of art.


¶16] In exchange for gold or silver none might get 
thee readily from the prop of Bregia's white-footed host; 
and it is not likely that thou wouldst be obtained by force.


¶17] From the chieftain of *Eachaidh*'s, race an exacting 
poet accepted nothing on earth save thee alone; thus 
was it easier to obtain thee.


¶18] Since one hath sought thee, after this *Aodh*, thou 
noble, alert, smooth, studded weapon, nobody will be 
forbearing towards any poet.

O'CARROLL
---------


¶1] Either O'Carroll or the rest are mistaken, these are 
some of the stories about him; who is it that is really 
mistaken? it is time to consider.


¶2] There are some of them hoarding their wealth, those 
that never cared for hospitality; and some that bear the 
palm from *Guaire*, head of every company.


¶3] A question for the companies of the Five Fifths, 
it should be-tackled; is it the bestower of kine who is 
most astray?


¶4] Wealth [*...*]*(?)*, and castles the others cherish them; 
*Cobhthach*'s, descendant has spent his own share, it is a 
wealth that endures.


¶5] The rest desert the professional poets of Ireland 
for common song, until *(?)* the man of *Cliú* checked their 
discourse, bright shield of Gowran.


¶6] It is a pity that the rest are not like O'Carroll, 
generous with cattle; given to*(?)* music and entertainment, 
blameless course.


¶7] *Maol Ruana*, king of *Cearbhall*'s stock, to whom 
Ireland rightfully belongs, to him the name is given as 
a just title—palm of hospitality—The Feale and the Cashen are two rivers in North 
Kerry, and it is these two prime rivers with beautiful 
banks that form a fishing estuary for the men of West 
Munster, and as the Feale is plundered of her fish she 
goes and floods the Cashen, and brings a prey of fish 
with her when returning. In such wise O'Carroll, when 
the keen, pungent-worded poets of *Fódla* plunder his land 
and his territory of riches and treasures and wealth, he 
sets upon the dour, unintelligibly-speaking outlanders, and 
they are plundered and burnt by him again and again.




---

p.163


¶8] Again and again is the great plain of the Moy 
plundered by *Maol Ruana*; a man who never puts off a 
bardic company, so great is his pride.


¶9] [*...*]*(?)* O'Carroll of the elfin blades; every man shall 
receive his own award if he reach the kingship.


¶10] It is not the son of Isabel, desirous of praise, who 
has made a mistake; all that hath joined him of the Plain 
of the Champions—bardic companies are its tax—


*Doladh* is a little town in East Munster, and nuns reside 
there, and a priest says mass every Sunday to those 
nuns, and good is the life *(?)* of that little town—


¶11] So that thence O'Carroll goes to raid Meath; to 
take cattle out of every town, firm is his courage [*...*]*(?)* 
gone into the cauldron to dispense liquor.


¶12] *Maol Ruana* is the *Cú Chulainn* of Munster in 
greatness of courage; is the house in which he is better 
for him than the House of Tara?


¶13] The warriors of the Gael gather around him to 
exercise steeds; he has surpassed Ireland, *Éile* and *Oileach* 
in generosity.


¶14] Heir of *Seaán* son of *Maol Ruana*, wheel of prowess; man who could contrive victory, guarantor of hosting—


And it was a wonderful hosting the Vicar Ó Conchobhair, 
and the Stronglegged Ó Léanaigh *(?)* the Big made, having 
resolved to make an alliance and compact with one 
another, and to go without pause or delay to battle with 
O'Daly—


¶15] The fuller was robbed when coming from the forge, 
having ground his teasel: often [*...*][20](javascript:footNote('T402563/note020.html'))


¶16] In Limerick there is many a gentle young woman, 
and many a whistling man who awakens the fierce, 
cold-beaked, deep-crawed snipe.




---

p.164


¶17] It is not easy to collect the cattle of the man of 
*Éile* [*...*]wrong and slaughter.


¶18] The cow of Athboy from its spancell, the cattle 
of striped Slieveroe have been brought by thee, O torrential 
champion, to *Éile*; many a running in their eyes for a 
time from the warrior—


And the Monday after Michaelmas a mayor is made 
in every big town in Ireland, and it is in this way he 
is made, the shaven-lipped, big-paunched, bulging*(?)*-eyed 
burgesses of those towns enter into courts built of gray 
masonry and stout timber, and he who has the largest 
retinue and following comes out as mayor, and it is a 
great wonder that O'Carroll does not even so go to Tara 
and gather the Gaels of all Ireland around him—


¶19] As did the spirited kin from whom he is sprung; 
often is the fury of—*Fearghal*'s descendants curbed by the 
warrior of Limerick.


¶20] Many a heron *(?)* on the slope of *Turlach* and fawn 
of *Leamhain* *(?)*; no dull gathering on Sunday is the tribe 
of O'Kearney—


And as for O'Kearney, he used to be in Cashel, and 
it is for him O'Grady made the whisky, and sent one 
of his followers for spice, that is pepper and aniseed, 
telling him to memorise that well, like any lesson, and 
the boy started learning it well, as he had been told, 
and on drawing near the big town he got an extraordinary 
and unfortunate tumble, and this is what he said as he 
was getting up: 'pepper and aniseed.'


¶21] He brought a load of the same [*...*], to O'Grady's 
castle; when he went to *Port an Phúdair**(?)* he left distress *(?)*


¶22] Like to the cold Hill of Howth is the frown of 
O'Grady, by the Grúda men nimbly cast trout into 
boats.


¶23] I am frenzied *[and (?)]* every one in the country 
around me, with love for the bright-toothed one, a love 
unsupportable.




---

p.165


¶24] I am called O'Carroll's rimer in the land of Munster; 
him with whom I have the best place I shall make chief 
of the heroes.


The stag hath no natural liking for the bay of the 
dogs; Lorcan's descendant [*...*]*(?)* a miserable yeoman: 
there is many a heron and wild goose on the land of Ulster.


¶25] The like of O'Carroll have I heard of in the battle 
of Cnuca; he was foremost in all their feasts, large his 
pigs—And Walter Mape was roasting two pigs for the king 
of England, that is, a fat pig and a lean one, and he 
took to greasing the fat pig with butter and oil, and he 
let the lean pig burn, and thus the English of lovely 
*Fódla* and the nobles of Munster act towards O'Carroll, 
for they give him gold and silver and manifold riches, 
while they give neither little or much to Carew, though 
he is nearer to the Lake of *Ribh*, son of *Muiridh* than 
the woman who comes from *Dún Mic Padraicín* to 
Owenogarney to gather limpets.


¶26] Over in *Trian Chonghail* there is many a breast 
in [*...*]*(?)*[21](javascript:footNote('T402563/note021.html'))


¶27] A Tara is that rampart of *Maol Ruana*, where 
there are companies [*...*]*(?)*; in *Maol Ruana*'s, castle there is 
many a gathering [*...*]*(?)*


¶28] *Magh Dreimhne* surpasses every other plain [*...*]*(?)* 
it is the darling child of the noble dwellings, praiseworthy 
are its people—And as for the tribe of Munterhagan, they are in 
Meath, and they are wont to be killing and quarrelling 
with one another over the name of the head of the tribe, 
a name that no other of the men of Ireland would like 
to bear as tribal chief, and that is, The Fox—a fellow 
without clothing, without cattle, deceitful, false—


¶166] 


¶29] A gray-muzzled fellow, treacherous, shifty, crafty 
[*...*] he would bring a hen from the marsh *(*or*the Curragh?)*, 
a guileful deed, he would not exchange for gold or cattle 
a seal or a mackerel.


¶30] Generous-hearted O'Carroll, sought of travellers;
no one else hath such repute save Art the Lonely.


¶31] Art the Lonely or *Oilill* Bare-ear, from whom he 
is sprung; it is shameful for all the bardic companies 
in Cashel not to join him.


¶32] In fear of the champion the warlike English have 
retreated to the coast; shortly will he leave the castles 
of the foreigners deserted.


¶33] If the honor of all the men of Ireland be considered,
with accurate, knowledge, the fame of O'Carroll should
be balanced with that of two kindreds *[i. e. should be
handicapped by competing against two instead of one]*
in the balancing—And it is a wonderful leap that is taken by some of 
the people in the eastern world, that is, to ascend the 
lofty mountain overlooking Paradise, and they look 
downwards and laugh, and go thence to Paradise, and 
return from there no more: even thus, then, do the 
landless men, the nobles, the travellers and men of art
of Ireland in the case of O'Carroll's castle.


¶34] As he competed with*(?)* the minstrels—attempting 
a good division *(?)*, the warrior for whom a blue vessel is 
bright, our house of safeguard.


¶35] *Éile* of the ruddy appletrees whose fruit is good, 
the produce of the fragrant branches conceals every path 
in its way.


¶36] Murmuring streams running shallow at the beginning 
of summer, from the heat of the winter every fish goes 
a foot deep into the earth.




---

p.167


¶37] In the dwelling of O'Carroll of *Cobhthach*'s Plain, 
who never loved hoarding *(?)*, there is many a maiden in 
the spring and scores of hags—


And a hag who was in the house of MacDermot of 
Moylurg and [*...*] save one year there, and that hag left 
[*...*] honorable and famous always from that year, and 
that is wonderful, seeing that there are—


¶38] One hundred hags in O'Carroll's dwelling, God 
defend it; the King of all is with the youth, Mary and 
*Íde**(?)*.


¶39] [*...*]from every man, no portent of conflict, however 
near in time*(?)* he gets in his castle hundreds of champions, 
bright, long visitation.


That man is deceived who would not wrest a passing 
pleasure from the goods of life, seeing they are but a 
phantom like the mist; to my mind it were better to lavish them justly therein, 
since assuredly none will carry them away from this dungeon of deceit.

HUGH O'BYRNE
------------


[22](javascript:footNote('T402563/note022.html'))
¶1] Despise not, O Hugh, the love of *Íor*'s spouse, 
grievous is it for thee that this land of Niall should be 
neglected; surely if thou comest—according to the words 
of Flann *(*or* surely)*, it is said, if Flann's words come 
true) [*...*]*(?)* will be under tribute to thee.


¶2] Stretch forth thy*(?)* vigor as a woodbine enclasping 
a tree when [*...*]; the son of John is censured by the 
array of English, when he comes down on the land to 
banish the foreign soldiery.


¶3] And to take hostages of him who does not join 
with him, when thou art under the protection of thy armor 
and weapons, [*...*]*(?)* on the embroidery of banners, a full 
[*...*]*(?)* of silk on the bottom of a rough equipment *(?)*.


¶4] A tough, seasoned blade against which English 
armor is no protection, and a sheltering gauntlet on thy 
forearm down to the fingers; a tall war-horse, none 
straighter leaps a gap, and a [*...*]*(?)*.


¶5] A spear which the royal son of noble *Tuireann*
possessed and was, it is said, for a time in the fairy 
castle of *Aonghus*; for thee was it destined, thou gallant 
son of John, the lines of the shield are written on thy 
name *(?)*.


¶6] Scarcely a day but this hero of the six couplets 
has the gains of a king*(?)*, when he puts on his armor; 
the shouts *(?)* of warriors facing battle-furies, and maniacs 
of the wind arising therefrom in the glen.




---

p.169


¶7] The clergy of the churches consider not half of his 
wealth enough as an additional tribute from those who 
used to go there *(?)* and from all who gather about the 
son of John at night, the poets seating themselves under 
his protection according to their rank *(?)*.


¶8] [*...*]under him, students of books, fairy *timpáns* 
praising him with harp-strings of [*...*]*(?)*; womenfolk with 
no useful craft save weaving textures [*...*] *(?)*


¶9] ? *(Translation omitted.)*


¶10] ? *(Translation omitted.)*


¶11] Many a thing hath the generous son of John accomplished, 
Leinster's ancient plain without *(need of)* 
a shepherd over any flock, [*...*] *(?)*, while this best of men 
is king over the land.

FRIENDS BEYOND THE SEA
----------------------


¶1] Delightful is this day in London, many noble, loveable 
youths of my friendship have gone from me eastwards 
to London for a time.


¶2] Many a darling, many a heart's core amongst my 
loving ones are there; many a wealthy scion to-day of 
the old nobility of the Children of *Míl*.


¶3] It were pleasant to be amongst them, those with 
whom my spirits would rise; many in London are my 
loved ones, my friends and companions.


¶4] Across the sea to London were taken the voices 
which were sweetest to my mind; the delight of the 
generous, white-footed scions, the converse of my comrades 
and my friends.


¶5] Just five of those who are away east should I see 
every day in London, *not evil were this journey*[23](javascript:footNote('T402563/note023.html')) from 
my house, it is not easy to treat of them.


¶6] Though we should never suffer any wrong or want 
save *(the loss of)* these five, no five of Bregia's land 
would equal these noble generous warriors.


¶7] *Donnchadh Ó Briain*, fruitful blossom, beloved 
*Donnchadh Ó Conchobhair*, two guarding griffins of
*Banbha*'s shore, in cold, strange London.


¶8] Small is my share of repose since *Donnchadh* 
descendant of Conn the Hundred-fighter is gone, and my 
beloved companion, *Donnchadh* descendant of Brian 
Bóroimhe.




---

p.171


¶9] O'Farrell's son, my own *Írial*, is in bright, perilous 
London; it is unkindly for me not to fare across the wave 
since my three darlings are there.


¶10] Something more than twelve years has *Pádraicín*
Plunket been in the gay court of fair apple-trees, without 
visiting the soil of Ireland.


¶11] Though never before did I see the dragon of 
Dunsany, he is before me every night, a graceful, bright, 
fresh-countenanced hero.


¶12] *Pádraicín*, my *Írial*, my loved ones; my two *Donnchaidh*, a gracious pair; it is a presage of pleasure for Conn's land that these should come to us.


¶13] The fifth man that is yonder, my soul, *Brian Mág 
Eochagán*, he went across the sea to London; it has 
lessened the glory of the Gaels.


¶14] *Donnchadh*, *Pádraicín* and Brian, my other *Donnchadh* and my *Írial*, if those whom I expect are there my day in London should be delightful.


¶15] My three darling companions, William, Richard, 
*Rudhraighe*; three that were never false to their side, three 
that are dearer than life.

p.172


THE BUTTER
----------


¶1] I myself got good butter from a woman; the good 
butter—if it be good—I dont think it was from a cow, 
whatever it was of destroyed me.


¶2] There was a beard sprouting on it, bad health to 
the fellow's beard; a juice from it as venomous as poison, 
it was tallow with the taste of a sour draught.


¶3] It was speckled, it was gray; it was not from a 
milch goat; it was no gift of butter when we had to look 
at it every day.


¶4] Its long lock like a horse's mane, alas, knives to 
crop it were not found; long sick is he who partook of 
it, the good butter that was in our hut.


¶5] A wrapping-cloth about the sour grease like a 
shroud taken from a corpse: disgusting to the eye it 
was to look at the rag from the amount of its foulness.


¶6] There was a stench from that fellow that choked 
and stupefied us; it seemed to us to be of all colours, 
with a branching crest of fungus over its head.


¶7] It had never seen the salt; the salt had never seen 
it, save from a distance; the remembrance of it does not 
leave us in health, white butter bluer than coal!


¶8] There was grease in it, and not that alone, but 
every other bit was of wax; little butter did I eat after 
it, the butter I got that was flesh.




---

p.173


A FALSE FRIAR
-------------


¶1] Of what land art thou, friar? humility is one of 
the graces: give us plain information, that we may not 
be in ignorance about thee.


¶2] Is it a part of thy Rule? explain, friar, and relate, 
why are thy shoes sound and thy hat tattered ?


¶3] Considering till the swamp thou hast travelled, thou 
valiant, wet-footed friar, I marvel at the cleanness of thy 
hose whilst thy hat is covered with dirt.


¶4] Was it in thy Rule, thou friar from Connacht, that 
thy shoes and hose should be stout and thy hat very frail ?


¶5] Methinks I see not a single fault in thy long and 
correct costume, beloved, melodious friar, save that thy 
hat is not worth a farthing.


¶6] Including coat and cap, habit and hose, more than 
any other article of thy dress has thy hat been ill-fashioned.


¶7] I make no complaint of thy habit, thou contemptible 
friar; look behind thee and before, for there is a rent in 
thy hat.


¶8] Thy hat, student, from whomsoever in Ireland it 
has been stolen, that is not the hat of an honest man 
which is ever being secretly offered for sale.


¶9] It is not its faulty fashioning, it is not the badness 
of its colour, prevented it being from sold in Cavan, but 
the fact that it is a stolen hat.




---

p.174


¶10] Uttering it for sale, friar, that is what has brought 
about thy ruin; here is a proverb-made, 'alas for him 
who brought a hat to Sligo.'


¶11] It is not the Earl's practice to suffer a friar to 
steal; if thou art sent in [*...*]*(?)* the hat will be striped.


¶12] Good are thy shirt and thy vest, neat is thy step 
on the causeway, fine moreover is thy mantle, but badly 
doth thy hat become thee.


¶13] Why is thy habit short, and thy cloak down to 
thy heels, and thy hat damp and high *(*or* broad?)*, of 
what land art thou, friar?




---

p.175


A VISION
--------


¶1] There was a vision of a fairy woman here last night, 
alas for him who beheld the royal vision; a woman such 
as she we have never looked upon, -the vision which 
perturbed my mind.


¶2] Dear the shape which came here to me last night 
in my slumber; the sleep of the night in which the dream 
came will ever be talked of by us.


¶3] Bright-cheeked countenance, the rose is not more 
red, had the maiden, such was her description; eyes like 
a hyacinth petal, and even, jet-black brows.


¶4] Slender lips, sweet as honey, had the maiden, with 
the hue of a budding rose; every gentle utterance of 
hers was enough to heal the ailing.


¶5] In the softly speaking mouth were white teeth like 
a shower of pearl; about them a delicate resting place 
for her lips, like two couches of [*...*]*(?)*


¶6] Between the arms with long hands are placed 
these—the graceful mounds of fair, white breasts, with 
a covering of golden interlacement.


¶7] The covering of her feet was achieved by the gift 
of *Aonghus**(?)*, two shoes with golden borders were worn 
by the bright, sweet, fair, maidenly girl.


¶8] A purple mantle with satin fringes, a red-bordered 
golden tunic; fettered hostages of gold formed the vest 
around the loveable, fairy maiden.


¶9] The gentle, tender one greeted me with modest 
words, and thereupon I replied to the bright, noble-looking 
beauty.




---

p.176


¶10] A while after that I questioned the maiden: 'of 
what kingdom art thou, from the king of what land art 
thou come?'


¶11] 'Two divisions or three there are of the world, 
the easier is it to traverse them to seek tidings of me,' 
said the woman, 'my secret I shall not reveal.'


¶12] 'In search of thee have I come, come with me'
said the maiden covertly, in a musical voice, gentle, 
sweet-substanced *(?)*, modest-worded.


¶13] I know not—what beguilement—when I refused 
to go with her, whither the wise, tender-hearted beauty 
flew from me.


¶14] It was a separation of body and soul for the rosy, 
brown-lashed queen to leave me when departing, the 
fair, modest, justly-speaking maiden.


¶15] To the land of *Fódla*, long ago, there came before 
like this the woman who beguiled royal *Connla* the Red: 
more peaceful her deeds the second time.


¶16] The best son his father had, *Connla*, son of 
Hundred-fighting Conn—through the wiles of one woman he goes 
across the wave, there never went in a ship one to 
equal him.


¶17] Such another visit as that the woman with the 
brown cloak and the musical branch made from beyond 
the wave to the son of *Feabhal*; famous is the wonderful 
story.


¶18] Nine times nine of the children of champions from 
the nobility of Desmond did that woman carry away 
with her, even as she carried Bran, he was an additional 
triumph.


¶19] The beguilement of Bran, the coaxing of *Connla* 
across the sea by foreign women, thus also am I deceived, 
this seems the most wonderful of all.




---

p.177


¶20] *Midear*'s fairy mound with its bright-portaled *(?)* rampart, the castle of *Sanbh*, or the fairy mound of 
*Abhartach*—you know not of a woman in these castles 
to equal the gentle, softly-speaking one.


¶21] There would not be found in *Eamhain* of the 
Apple trees, or in the mansion of golden-weaponed *Aonghus*, 
a fairy woman comparable to the gentle, bright-formed, 
brown-browed maid.


¶22] Since the woman departed from us, I would fain, 
if it were possible, be not merely a sojourner, in her 
land *(?)*


¶23] After my love for her bright face, when the maiden 
had left me, as an ebb comes in every tide, the exaltation 
of my spirit was quenched.




---

p.178


A VISION
--------


¶1] Art thou the woman who was here last night with 
me in a vision? uncertain about thee as I am, thou 
bright form, my mind is bewildered.


¶2] If thou be not she who came before, O slender 
figure, gentle and soft of hand, and dainty of step, thou 
art exactly similar.


¶3] Thy glowing cheek, thy blue eye—never were there 
formed from the four-fold element two more similar in 
form, O yellow, curly, plaited locks.


¶4] Thy white teeth, thy crimson lips which make 
sufficing lullaby, brown brows of the hue of the sloe, 
and all that lies between them.


¶5] Throat like the blossom of the lily, long, slender 
hands; supple, plump flesh, of the hue of the waves, 
dulling the whiteness of the river's foam.


¶6] Small, smooth, white breasts rising above a lovely, 
shining slope; gentle expanses, with borders most fair 
and delightful, they are to be likened to fairy knolls.


¶7] On the ends of thy luxuriant tresses are flocks not 
usual in winter, which have been bathed in pure gold; a 
most wondrous flock.


¶8] I am worthy of trust, thou art in no danger, tell 
me was it thou who came before to the land of *Fál* to 
trouble me, thou shining, white-toothed, modest-faced lady?


¶9] Or art thou she who came afore-time to visit the 
Round Table, thou head of smooth, fair, bright locks, 
to wondrous King Arthur?




---

p.179


¶10] Or art thou she who came to great *Aodh*, son of 
*Úghoine*, from the seductive streams of the fairy mound 
of Slievenamon to the mortal *(?)* plain of Ireland?


¶11] Or art thou she who came another time to the 
camp of Brian *Bóroimhe*, to bear Murrough across the 
Irish Sea, and eastwards across the surface of the ocean ?


¶12] Or art thou she who came from bright, fruitful 
Rathtrim to beguile the son of *Deichtine*, the valorous 
Hound of *Culann*?


¶13] Or art thou she that came afore-time, thou bright, 
angel-like form, to the land of battlesome *Banbha*, to 
*Mathghamhain Ó Máille*?


¶14] Or art thou she who came again to seduce the 
youths, in the days of *Conaire*, O bright cheek, to the 
chosen host of Teltown?


¶15] Or art thou she, thou staunch heart, who bore 
Bran, son of white-footed *Feabhal*, across the smooth 
surface of the sea, to the chosen Land of Promise?


¶16] There came, perhaps thou art of them, to the 
king of Connacht—a famous visit, beautiful women—a 
gathering of power, to the shores of noble Loch Derg.


¶17] Or didst thou beguile *Connla* the Red, from the 
host of *Banbha* of the cold, wet summits; O bright form, 
not unseemly of looks, though he was guarded by the 
sages of the people?


¶18] Or didst thou beguile myself before, thou shining 
form, since thou, O slender, fairy-like lady, art continually 
spoiling the men of Ireland?


¶19] All the more do I suspect that thou art the other 
woman I saw, because there is none save thee to equal her in beautiful, leafy *Banbha*.


¶20] There is not in the fairy mounds of the Boyne a 
woman of thy beauty save that woman, nor in the fair 
castles of *Síodh na gCuan*, thou gentle, white-formed, 
pleasing one.

¶21] Nor in the fairy mound of oared Assaroe, or in 
the castle of the *Ioldánach*'s fosterfather, or in the smooth, 
warm-couched mound of Trim, or in the many-shaped 
castle of *Eochall*.


¶22] After her no woman shall we see in dream or in 
fantasy, until she comes to us again, returning in a vision.


¶23] Once or twice has my form been blighted by 
her soft face, it will happen a third time, the wondrous, 
shining beauty.

THE CALVACH O'CONOR
-------------------


¶1] Hasten to us, O Calvach, advance across the darkly-eddying 
sea; thou goal of the poets of Conn's territory, 
come to us at the first message.


¶2] Thou kindly-faced son of Donnell, this message we 
send to thee, let it be a pressing business for thee, let 
it not be delayed over a jest.


¶3] Many fresh tidings have we for thy smiling, brown-lashed 
countenance, thou king of *Eine*'s grassy plain, 
which were a fit reason for haste.


¶4] The men of London, the warriors of Scotland are 
contending together, thou chief of the noble host of 
*Síoth Truim*, in one compact mass about us.


¶5] From fear of foray none, from the Shannon to the 
river of Sligo, O sparkling, heavy-pented, straightly-glancing 
eye, can sleep for one hour at a stretch.


¶6] Lest the others complain of thee, array thyself, come 
to our help, give to this district an opportunity of repose, 
have they not said enough?


¶7] Hasten thee, thou son of *Mór*, great is the reason 
for unrest, thou defending arm of the folds of Conn[*...*][24](javascript:footNote('T402563/note024.html'))


¶8] [*gap: extent: entire stanza*]


¶9] The athletic feats of their champions, the courageous 
spirit of their youths, the shining, smooth, white skin 
of their women, the agreeable speech of their men of letters.

p.182


¶10] Headstrong children plundering hives, hawks in 
pursuit of birds; graceful stags bounding from height to 
height, ships, and hounds contending in speed.


¶11] Journeying over the slopes of Loch Gill; the produce 
of the stream of Sligo; nuts coming upon the white, 
thickly-growing hazel-trees about their border ditches.


¶12] The coupled mansion, with its golden goblets, 
precious treasures, red satin garments, bright, square, 
smooth battlements [*...*][25](javascript:footNote('T402563/note025.html'))


¶13] Let not the excellence of their ale, or their quilts, 
or their charmed, stout, smooth ramparts cause thee to 
linger, Calvach O'Conor.


¶14] Let not the warriors of Carbury's swan-flecked 
waters, the noble clans of *Síol* Murray, beguile thee 
amongst them, thou hand ungentle on the iron of spear-shafts.


¶15] Away from them take, for another while, in a 
propitious hour and time, an unhesitating step against 
the foreigner, thou graceful stem from *Conchobhar*'s, plain.


¶16] [*gap: extent: two lines*][26](javascript:footNote('T402563/note026.html')) thou slender-lipped hero of Bearnas.


¶17] Thou appletree from Paradise, thou precious, softly-worded
jewel, thou hindrance of the suffering of Conn's 
race, thou art able to guard us.


¶18] If thy coming to us be heard of, O clustering 
locks, foeman *will not dare* to look from on high at 
the borders of this fair country from which one must go.


¶19] Were I not urging *(?)* thee, I would censure thy 
bright face concerning this dispute with thy fair cheek, 
in the white houses of Sligo's host.


¶20] Understand moreover, were I not dissatisfied with 
thy bright, steady glance, thy soft, white skin, thy supple 
form, I would not *(?)* forgive thee what thou hast done.


¶21] From the danger that I might reprove thee, rightly are thy censurers and [*...*][27](javascript:footNote('T402563/note027.html')) giving thanks that we are at odds.

A COMPLAINT
-----------


¶1] This is an address to the race of Colla, to complain 
amongst them, the mighty youth from the Plain of 
Mar, of the misfortunes which afflict me.


¶2] Do not overlook a single man of Colla's race 
from the fertile borders of *Cliún*, but address each of them 
severally, they are men who will not allow me to be 
refused.


¶3] Tell to my avengers, the progeny of Turlogh, 
son of Marcus, a company most modest towards poets, 
the sum of my wrong and injustice.


¶4] I shall tell thee, man, my complaint, my 
foreboding to the great affable, pleasant, generous throng, 
in the hope that thou wilt remember what I say.


¶5] Many scattered captains of bands, many quarterings and 
kern—alas for him who [*...*][28](javascript:footNote('T402563/note028.html')) wrong me.


¶6] The kern of the house next to me are full of 
wickedness and surliness, entering my house every other 
day, they and the assembly which is around me *(?)*

A CONTENTION
------------


#### 1


Tadhg Dall Ó Huiginn sang:


The Macawards, mangy whelps, blind [*...*]*(?)* of the 
Conall kindred; stuttering bards without a qualified poet
over them; alas for any who is in their company.


#### 2


A rejoinder from Mac an Bhaird:


The banner of the foray of Conn's land is half-blind *(?)*
Tadhg Ó Huiginn; is it not woeful for any who met
that devil of a blind fellow who was whetted in the cave
of hell?

A SATIRE
--------


This is the satire Tadhg Dall Ó Huiginn composed on the people
of the O'Hara family, for which they cut out his tongue etc.
¶1] A troop of six that came to my house, I shall give 
a description of them; scarce of milk was I the next 
morning, from the thirst of the six vagabonds.


¶2] It was a long time, seemingly, since a bit of cow's 
produce had entered their bodies, the twice three whom 
I have mentioned.


¶3] I was able—'tis a pity—to bring them from death 
to life; must needs they drink my milk, so great was 
the thirst from the dry bread.


¶4] I in want, and they in necessity—I am in a strait 
between the two; it is hard for me to repress these verses, 
yet is it sinful for me to make them.


¶5] It is best not to conceal the satire if any deserve 
censure; as I satirized the troop of six it is unfitting 
not to tell it.


¶6] The first that I saw, he was the best equipped of 
the band, a youth whose vest was not worth more than 
a groat; one whom feasting or gaming never impoverished.


¶7] The second man, as I found, coming in front of the 
company, was a miserable fellow whose marrow had gone 
from him, I shall not leave him out of the reckoning.


¶8] The munition of the third wretch was an old javelin 
and an untempered, gapped ax; he and his makings of 
an ax in an encounter, I pity such a battle-equipment.




---

p.186


¶9] The equipment of the fourth fellow who flux-smitten 
marched with them, four shafts, that never knocked a 
splinter out of target, slung across his rump.


¶10] At the heels of the four others comes the fifth 
rogue, in a short smock not worth a groat, I do not 
think his mantle was any better.


¶11] The likeness of a fellow not worth a fleshworm 
was along with the five; a gaunt *(?)*, transparent sort of 
fellow, he was a poor commodity on inspection.


¶12] I beseech God who shed His blood, since it is but 
decay for them to be alive—it is scarcely to be called 
living—that none may slay the troop of six.
