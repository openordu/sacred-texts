#### Sampling Declaration


The present text represents pages 30–36 of the volume.


#### Editorial Declaration


##### Correction


Text has been checked and proofread twice. All corrections and supplied text are tagged.


##### Hyphenation


When a hyphenated word 

(hard or soft) crosses a page break, the break is marked after the completion of the hyphenated word.


##### Segmentation


div0=the charters; div1=the section, comprising Irish text and English translation; each section being subdivided into div2s comprising the individual texts; page-breaks are marked.


##### Interpretation


Personal names and place names have not been tagged.


The acute accent represents long vowels and has been added by Jackson. The acute accent has no relation to the accents written in the MS. 

Where expanded contractions are italicised by Jackson in the printed version, the ex tag has been used in the digital edition. 

Most of Jackson's expansions are not italicised, but diplomatic texts are given in his hardcopy edition. The idiosyncratic spelling has not been corrected or normalised. 

Where missing letters are restored, the sup tag is used.

### I


Columba and Drostán son of Coscrach, his disciple, came from Iona, as God guided them, to Aberdour; and Bede the Pict was mormaer of Buchan on their arrival; and it is he who bestowed on them that monastery, in freedom till Doomsday from mormaer and toísech. They came after that to the other monastery, and it pleased Columba, for it was full of the grace of God. And he begged the mormaer, that is, Bede, that he should give it to them, and he did not. And a son of his took a sickness, after the clerics had been refused, and was all but dead. Thereupon the mormaer went to beseech the clerics that they should make a prayer on behalf of the boy, that health might come to him; and he gave to them *land* as a grant from Cloch in Tiprat as far as Cloch Peitte Meic-Garnait. They made the prayer, and health came to him. Thereupon Columba gave Drostán that monastery, and blessed it, and left the curse that whoever should go against it should not be full of years or of success. Drostán's tears *[déra]* came as he was parting from Columba. Columba said, ‘Let Deer be its name from this on.’


### II


Comgell son of Aed gave from Oirte as far as Púiréne to Columba and to Drostán. Muiredach son of Morgann gave Pett Meic-Garnait and the field of Toiche Teimne; and it is he who was mormaer and was toísech. Matain son of Cairell gave a mormaer's dues in Altrie and Cú Lí son of Baíthín gave a toísech's dues. Domnall son of Giric and Mal-Brigte son of Cathal gave Pett in Muilinn to Drostán. Cathal son of Morgann gave Achad na Cléirech to Drostán. Domnall son of Ruaidrí and Mal-Coluim son of Cuilén gave Biffie to God and to Drostán. Mal-Coluim son of Cinaed gave a king's dues in Biffie and in Pett Meic-Gobraig, and two **davochs** of upper Ros abard. Mal-Coluim son of Mal-Brigte gave Elrick. Mal-Snechta son of Lulach gave Pett Malduib to Drostán. Domnall son of Mac-Dubaicín **quenched** all the grants in favour of Drostán in return for giving him his goodwill. Cathal **quenched** his toísech's dues on the same terms, and gave a banquet for a hundred every Christmas and Easter to God and to Drostán. Cainnech son of Mac-Dobarchon and Cathal gave Altrie of the cliff of the birch-tree of the river-bend(?) as far as the birch-tree between the two Altries. Domnall and Cathal gave Ednie to God and to Drostán. Cainnech and Domnall and Cathal **quenched** all the grants in favour of God and of Drostán from beginning *to end, from mormaer and toísech till Doomsday.* *And the blessing of the Lord on every mormaer and every toísech who shall comply with it, and to their descendants after them.*


### III


Gartnait son of Cainnech and Ete daughter of Gille-Michéil gave Pett Meic-Gobraig for the consecration of a church of Christ and of Peter the apostle, and to Columba and Drostán, free of all imposts, with a bond for it to Cormac bishop of Dunkeld, the eighth year of the reign of David. These being the witnesses: Nechtan bishop of Aberdeen, and Léot abbot of Brechin, and Mal-Domnaig(?) son of Mac-Bethad, and Aluine son of Aircill, and Ruaidrí mormaer of Mar, and Mataidín the judge, and Gille-Críst son of Cormac, and Mal-Petair son of Domnall, and Domangart lector of Turriff, and Gille-Coluim son of Muiredach, and Duibne son of Mal-Coluim.


### IV


Gartnait and the daughter of Gille-Michéil gave Ball Domain in Pitfour to Christ and to Columba and to Drostán. Witness, Gille-Caillíne the priest, and Feradach son of Mal-Bricín, and Mal-Giric son of Tráillín.


### V


Donnchad son of Mac-Bethad son of Ided gave Auchmachar to Christ and to Drostán and to Columba, in freedom till Doomsday. In witness of it, Mal-Fhéichín and Comgell and Gille-Críst son of Finguine, as testimony, and Mal-Coluim son of Moíléne. Cormac son of Cennéitech gave as far as Skillymarno. Comgell son of Cainnech, toísech of Clann Chanann, gave to Christ and to Drostán as far as the great pillar-stone at the end of the thicket nearest to Ailldin Ailenn, from Dubuice to Lurchaire, both rough-grazing and pasture, *free of toisech till Doomsday; and his curse on everyone who shall come against it.*


### VI


Colbán, mormaer of Buchan, and Éva, daughter of Garnait his wedded wife, and Donnchad son of Síthech, toísech of Clann Morgainn, **quenched** all the grants from all imposts, in favour of God and of Drostán and of Columba and of Peter the apostle, in return for the dues on four **davochs'***-worth* of that which should devolve on the chief religious houses of Scotland in general and on its chief churches. These being the witnesses: Bróiccín, and Cormac abbot of Turriff, and Morgann son of Donnchad, and Gille-Petair son of Donnchad, and Mal-Fhéichín, and the two sons of Maitne, and all the **good men** of Buchan in witness of it, at Ellon.


### VII


David king of Scots, to all his **good men**, greetings. You are to know that the clergy of Deer are to be quit and immune from all lay service and improper exaction, as is written in their book, and as they proved by argument at Banff and swore at Aberdeen. Wherefore I strictly enjoin that no-one shall dare to do any harm to them or to their goods. Witness, Gregory bishop of Dunkeld. Witness, Andrew bishop of Caithness. Witness, Samson bishop of Brechin. Witness, Donnchad earl of Fife and Mal-Moire of Atholl and Gille-Brigte earl of Angus, and Gille-Coimded son of Aed, and Bróiccín, and Cormac of Turriff, and Adam son of Ferdomnach, and Gille-Aindrias son of Maitne; at Aberdeen.
