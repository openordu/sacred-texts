1. All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
  
One time it was a woman's face, or worse—
  
The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
  
Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
  
Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
  
I had not given a penny for a song
  
Did not the poet sing it with such airs
  
That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
  
Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
  
Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.
