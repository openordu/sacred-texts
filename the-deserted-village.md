### The Deserted Village: Author: Oliver Goldsmith




---

p.23


1. 1] Sweet

**AUBURN**! loveliest village of the plain,
  
2] Where health and plenty cheer'd the labouring swain,
  
3] Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
  
4] And parting summer's lingering blooms delay'd:
  
5] Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,
  
6] Seats of my youth, when every sport could please:
  
7] How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green,
  
8] Where humble happiness endear'd each scene!
  
9] How often have I paused on every charm,
  
10] The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,
  
11] The never-failing brook, the busy mill,
  
12] The decent church that topp'd the neighbouring hill;
  
13] The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,
  
14] For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made!
  
15] How often have I bless'd the coming day,
  
16] When toil, remitting, lent its turn to play,
  
17] And all the village train, from labour free,
  
18] Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree!
  
19] While many a pastime circled in the shade,
  
20] The young contending as the old survey'd;


---

p.24


21] And many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground,
  
22] And sleights of art and feats of strength went round;
  
23] And still, as each repeated pleasure tir'd,
  
24] Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd;
  
25] The dancing pair that simply sought renown,
  
26] By holding out to tire each other down;
  
27] The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,
  
28] While secret laughter titter'd round the place;
  
29] The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love;
  
30] The matron's glance, that would those looks reprove;
  
31] These were thy charms, sweet village; sports like these,
  
32] With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please;
  
33] These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed;
  
34] These were thy charms—But all these charms are fled.
2. 35] Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,
  
36] Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;
  
37] Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,
  
38] And Desolation saddens all thy green:
  
39] One only master grasps the whole domain,
  
40] And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain.
  
41] No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,
  
42] But, chok'd with sedges, works its weedy way.
  
43] Along thy glades, a solitary guest,
  
44] The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;
  
45] Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,
  
46] And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.
  
47] Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,
  
48] And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall
  
49] And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,
  
50] Far, far away thy children leave the land.

p.25

5. 51] Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,
  
52] Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:
  
53] Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;
  
54] A breath can make them, as a breath has made:
  
55] But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
  
56] When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.
6. 57] A time there was, ere

**England**'s griefs began,
  
58] When every rood of ground maintain'd its man;
  
59] For him light labour spread her wholesome store,
  
60] Just gave what life requir'd, but gave no more:
  
61] His best companions, innocence and health;
  
62] And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
7. 63] But times are alter'd; trade's unfeeling train
  
64] Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain;
  
65] Along the lawn, where scatter'd hamlets rose,
  
66] Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;
  
67] And every want to opulence allied,
  
68] And every pang that folly pays to pride.
  
69] Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,
  
70] Those calm desires that ask'd but little room,
  
71] Those healthful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene,
  
72] Liv'd in each look, and brighten'd all the green;
  
73] These, far departing, seek a kinder shore,
  
74] And rural mirth and manners are no more.
8. 75] Sweet

**AUBURN**! parent of the blissful hour,
  
76] Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power,
  
77] Here, as I take my solitary rounds,
  
78] Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds,
  
79] And, many a year elaps'd, return to view
  
80] Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,

p.26


81] Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,
  
82] Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.
9. 83] In all my wand'rings through this world of care,
  
84] In all my griefs—and God has given my share—
  
85] I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,
  
86] Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
  
87] To husband out life's taper at the close,
  
88] And keep the flame from wasting by repose:
  
89] I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,
  
90] Amidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,
  
91] Around my fire an evening group to draw,
  
92] And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;
  
93] And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,
  
94] Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,
  
95] I still had hopes, my long vexations pass'd,
  
96] Here to return—and die at home at last.
10. 97] O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,
  
98] Retreats from care, that never must be mine,
  
99] How blest is he who crowns in shades like these,
  
100] A youth of labour with an age of ease;
  
101] Who quits a world where strong temptations try,
  
102] And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!
  
103] For him no wretches, born to work and weep,
  
104] Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;
  
105] No surly porter stands in guilty state,
  
106] To spurn imploring famine from the gate;
  
107] But on he moves to meet his latter end,
  
108] Angels around befriending Virtue's friend;
  
109] Sinks to the grave with unperceived decay,
  
110] While Resignation gently slopes the way;


---

p.27


111] And, all his prospects bright'ning to the last,
  
112] His heaven commences ere the world be pass'd!
11. 113] Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening's close,
  
114] Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;
  
115] There, as I pass'd with careless steps and slow,
  
116] The mingling notes came soften'd from below;
  
117] The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,
  
118] The sober herd that low'd to meet their young,
  
119] The noisy geese that gobbled o'er the pool,
  
120] The playful children just let loose from school;
  
121] The watchdog's voice that bay'd the whisp'ring wind,
  
122] And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;
  
123] These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,
  
124] And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made.
  
125] But now the sounds of population fail,
  
126] No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,
  
127] No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread
  
128] But all the bloomy flush of life is fled.
  
129] All but yon widow'd, solitary thing,
  
130] That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;
  
131] She, wretched matron, forc'd, in age, for bread,
  
132] To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,
  
133] To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,
  
134] To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;
  
135] She only left of all the harmless train,
  
136] The sad historian of the pensive plain.
12. 137] Near yonder copse, where once the garden smil'd,
  
138] And still where many a garden flower grows wild,
  
139] There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
  
140] The village preacher's modest mansion rose.


---

p.28


141] A man he was to all the country dear,
  
142] And passing rich with forty pounds a year.
  
143] Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
  
144] Nor e'er had chang'd, nor wished to change, his place;
  
145] Unpractis'd he to fawn, or seek for power
  
146] By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;
  
147] Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,
  
148] More skill'd to raise the wretched than to rise.
  
149] His house was known to all the vagrant train;
  
150] He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain;
  
151] The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,
  
152] Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
  
153] The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,
  
154] Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;
  
155] The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
  
156] Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;
  
157] Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
  
158] Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.
  
159] Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,
  
160] And quite forgot their vices in their woe;
  
161] Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
  
162] His pity gave ere charity began.
13. 163] Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
  
164] And even his failings lean'd to Virtue's side;
  
165] But in his duty prompt at every call,
  
166] He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for all:
  
167] And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,
  
168] To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies,
  
169] He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
  
170] Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.

p.29

16. 171] Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
  
172] And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,
  
173] The reverend champion stood. At his control,
  
174] Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
  
175] Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
  
176] And his last falt'ring accents whisper'd praise.
17. 177] At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
  
178] His looks adorn'd the venerable place;
  
179] Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,
  
180] And fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.
  
181] The service pass'd, around the pious man
  
182] With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
  
183] E'en children follow'd, with endearing wile,
  
184] And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile;
  
185] His ready smile a parent's warmth express'd;
  
186] Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distress'd;
  
187] To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given
  
188] But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.
  
189] As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,
  
190] Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
  
191] Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
  
192] Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
18. 193] Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
  
194] With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,
  
195] There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
  
196] The village master taught his little school;
  
197] A man severe he was, and stern to view;
  
198] I knew him well, and every truant knew:
  
199] Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
  
200] The day's disasters in his morning face;


---

p.30


201] Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee
  
202] At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
  
203] Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
  
204] Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd;.
  
205] Yet he was kind; or if severe in aught,
  
206] The love he bore to learning was in fault;
  
207] The village all declared how much he knew;
  
208] 'Twas certain he could write, and cypher too;
  
209] Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
  
210] And e'en the story ran that he could gauge.
  
211] In arguing too, the parson own'd his skill,
  
212] For e'en though vanquish'd, he could argue still;
  
213] While words of learned length and thund'ring sound
  
214] Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around,
  
215] And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew,
  
216] That one small head could carry all he knew.
19. 217] But past is all his fame. The very spot
  
218] Where many a time he triumph'd, is forgot.
  
219] Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,
  
220] Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,
  
221] Now lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspir'd,
  
222] Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retir'd,
  
223] Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,
  
224] And news much older than their ale went round.
  
225] Imagination fondly stoops to trace
  
226] The parlour splendours of that festive place;
  
227] The white-wash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,
  
228] The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;
  
229] The chest, contriv'd a double debt to pay,
  
230] A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;


---

p.31


231] The pictures plac'd for ornament and use,
  
232] The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;
  
233] The hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,
  
234] With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;
  
235] While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,
  
236] Ranged o'er the chimney, glisten'd in a row.
20. 237] Vain, transitory splendours! Could not all
  
238] Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall!
  
239] Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart
  
240] An hour's importance to the poor man's heart.
  
241] Thither no more the peasant shall repair,
  
242] To sweet oblivion of his daily care;
  
243] No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,
  
244] No more the wood-man's ballad shall prevail;
  
245] No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,
  
246] Relax his pond'rous strength, and lean to hear;
  
247] The host himself no longer shall be found
  
248] Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;
  
249] Nor the coy maid, half willing to be press'd,
  
250] Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.
21. 251] Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,
  
252] These simple blessings of the lowly train;
  
253] To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
  
254] One native charm, than all the gloss of art;
  
255] Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,
  
256] The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;
  
257] Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,
  
258] Unenvied, unmolested, unconfin'd:
  
259] But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,
  
260] With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd,


---

p.32


261] In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,
  
262] The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
  
263] And, even while fashion's brightest arts decoy,
  
264] The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.
22. 265] Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey
  
266] The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,
  
267] 'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand
  
268] Between a splendid and a happy land.
  
269] Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,
  
270] And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;
  
271] Hoards, e'en beyond the miser's wish, abound,
  
272] And rich men flock from all the world around.
  
273] Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name
  
274] That leaves our useful products still the same.
  
275] Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride
  
276] Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
  
277] Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,
  
278] Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;
  
279] The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
  
280] Has robb'd the neighbouring fields of half their growth,
  
281] His seat, where solitary sports are seen,
  
282] Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;
  
283] Around the world each needful product flies,
  
284] For all the luxuries the world supplies:
  
285] While thus the land, adorn'd for pleasure, all
  
286] In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.
23. 287] As some fair female, unadorn'd and plain,
  
288] Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,
  
289] Slights every borrow'd charm that dress supplies,
  
290] Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes:


---

p.33


291] But when those charms are pass'd, for charms are frail,
  
292] When time advances, and when lovers fail,
  
293] She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,
  
294] In all the glaring impotence of dress.
  
295] Thus fares the land, by luxury betray'd;
  
296] In nature's simplest charms at first array'd;
  
297] But verging to decline, its splendours rise,
  
298] Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise;
  
299] While, scourg'd by famine from the smiling land
  
300] The mournful peasant leads his humble band;
  
301] And while he sinks, without one arm to save,
  
302] The country blooms—a garden and a grave.
24. 303] Where, then, ah! where shall poverty reside,
  
304] To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?
  
305] If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd,
  
306] He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,
  
307] Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,
  
308] And e'en the bare-worn common is denied.
25. 309] If to the city sped—What waits him there?
  
310] To see profusion that he must not share;
  
311] To see ten thousand baneful arts combin'd
  
312] To pamper luxury and thin mankind;
  
313] To see each joy the sons of pleasure know
  
314] Extorted from his fellow-creature's woe:
  
315] Here, while the courtier glitters in brocade,
  
316] There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;
  
317] Here, while the proud their long-drawn pomp display,
  
318] There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.
  
319] The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign,
  
320] Here, richly deck'd, admits the gorgeous train;


---

p.34


321] Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,
  
322] The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.
  
323] Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!
  
324] Sure these denote one universal joy!
  
325] Are these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes
  
326] Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies.
  
327] She once, perhaps, in village plenty bless'd,
  
328] Has wept at tales of innocence distress'd;
  
329] Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
  
330] Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;
  
331] Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue, fled,
  
332] Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,
  
333] And, pinch'd with cold, and, shrinking from the shower,
  
334] With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,
  
335] When idly first, ambitious of the town,
  
336] She left her wheel, and robes of country brown.
26. 337] Do thine, sweet

**AUBURN**, thine, the loveliest train,
  
338] Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?
  
339] E'en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,
  
340] At proud men's doors they ask a little bread!
27. 341] Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,
  
342] Where half the convex world intrudes between,
  
343] Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,
  
344] Where wild **Altama** murmurs to their woe.
  
345] Far different there from all that charm'd before,
  
346] The various terrors of that horrid shore;
  
347] Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,
  
348] And fiercely shed intolerable day;
  
349] Those matted woods where birds forget to sing,
  
350] But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;

351] Those poisonous fields, with rank luxuriance crown'd,
  
352] Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;
  
353] Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
  
354] The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;
  
355] Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,
  
356] And savage men more murderous still than they:
  
357] While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,
  
358] Mingling the ravag'd landscape with the skies.
  
359] Far different these from every former scene,
  
360] The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,
  
361] The breezy covert of the warbling grove,
  
362] That only shelter'd thefts of harmless love.
28. 363] Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that parting day,
  
364] That call'd them from their native walks away;
  
365] When the poor exiles, every pleasure pass'd,
  
366] Hung round their bowers, and fondly look'd their last,
  
367] And took a long farewell, and wish'd in vain,
  
368] For seats like these beyond the western main;
  
369] And shudd'ring still to face the distant deep,
  
370] Return'd and wept, and still return'd to weep.
  
371] The good old sire, the first prepared to go
  
372] To new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;
  
373] But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,
  
374] He only wish'd for worlds beyond the grave.
  
375] His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,
  
376] The fond companion of his helpless years,
  
377] Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,
  
378] And left a lover's for a father's arms.
  
379] With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,
  
380] And bless'd the cot where every pleasure rose,

381] And kiss'd her thoughtless babes with many a tear,
  
382] And clasp'd them close, in sorrow doubly dear;
  
383] Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
  
384] In all the silent manliness of grief.
29. 385] O Luxury! thou curs'd by Heaven's decree,
  
386] How ill exchang'd are things like these for thee!
  
387] How do thy potions, with insidious joy,
  
388] Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!
  
389] Kingdoms, by thee to sickly greatness grown,
  
390] Boast of a florid vigour not their own;
  
391] At every draught more large and large they grow,
  
392] A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;
  
393] Till sapp'd their strength, and every part unsound,
  
394] Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round.
30. 395] E'en now the devastation is begun,
  
396] And half the business of destruction done;
  
397] E'en now, methinks, as pond'ring here I stand,
  
398] I see the rural virtues leave the land:
  
399] Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,
  
400] That idly waiting flaps with ev'ry gale,
  
401] Downward they move, a melancholy band,
  
402] Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand.
  
403] Contented toil, and hospitable care,
  
404] And kind connubial tenderness are there;
  
405] And piety with wishes placed above,
  
406] And steady loyalty, and faithful love.
  
407] And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid
  
408] Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;
  
409] Unfit, in these degenerate times of shame,
  
410] To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;

411] Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,
  
412] My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;
  
413] Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,
  
414] That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;
  
415] Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,
  
416] Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!
  
417] Farewell! and Oh! where'er thy voice be tried,
  
418] On **Torno**'s cliffs, or **Pambamarca**'s side,
  
419] Whether where equinoctial fervours glow,
  
420] Or winter wraps the polar world in snow,
  
421] Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,
  
422] Redress the rigours of th' inclement clime;
  
423] Aid slighted truth; with thy persuasive strain
  
424] Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;
  
425] Teach him that states of native strength possess'd,
  
426] Though very poor, may still be very bless'd;
  
427] That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,
  
428] As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away;
  
429] While self-dependent power can time defy,
  
430] As rocks resist the billows and the sky.
