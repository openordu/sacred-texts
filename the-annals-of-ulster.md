#### Notes

[In this digital edition we have used Mac Airt & Mac Niocaill's translation of their edition (1983) 
of the annals for the entries up to AD 1131. Their translation (pp 3-37) of the Pre-Patrician or Irish World-Chronicle, which is best treated as a separate 
text, was omitted. Their edition extends from AD 431 to AD 1131.2. For the rest of the entries up to AD 1201 Hennessy & Mac Carthy's translation of their edition was used. The remainder of volumes 2 and 3 is in preparation.]

Mac Carthy, Annals of Ulster iv (Dublin 1901) ii-iii; scribe Ruaidhri Ó Luinín (to AD 1489), additional hands to 1504, 1510 (?); ends imperfect). There are lacunae for the years 1102-8, 1115.4-1162.3, and 1374-8. The first lacuna may be supplied from MS (ii); part of the second, viz. from 1115.5 to 1131.2 and from 1155 to 1162.3, may again be supplied from MS (ii); but for 1131.3 to late 1155 both MSS are lacunose.

A third scribe, whose name is not known, began on f. 107vb (the annal for 1507) continued, alternating from time to time with a fourth. Many hands appear in later folios, among them that of Matha Ó Luinín (died 1588) grandson of Ruaidhri Ó Luinín. MS (ii) is a fair copy of MS (i) but with supplementary entries, and it preserves some text lost by mutilation in MS (i) as detailed above. Lacunae: 1131.3-1155, 1307-15.

div0=the whole work;
div1=the individual annal (the text for a given year);
div2=the individual entry in an annal, which is numbered in the translation. Passages of verse occurring within text paragraphs or within marginalia are treated as embedded texts and, where relevant, stanzas are enumerated in the structural mark-up. 
The page-breaks of the printed texts are marked.

### Prefatory Note


THE Editor was desirous that the important publication of which this forms the first volume should be published in a complete form, and not in separate volumes, for the reason that, considering the great value of the Chronicle, the questions so often discussed regarding the compilers and the sources trom which the work was compiled, and the relation to each other of the MSS. from which the text has been formed, it seemed necessary that these subjects should be dealt with in an Introductory Essay. But it would be obviously impossible to write an Intro- duction of the nature required before the whole work was in print. The Council of the Royal Academy, under whose direction the publication of the work has been placed by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, having ordered the immediate publication of this volume, the Editor submitted respectfully to their directions. The Introduction must therefore appear in the last volume of the work in that, namely, containing 
the Appendices and Index.


W. M. H. 
June, 1887.
