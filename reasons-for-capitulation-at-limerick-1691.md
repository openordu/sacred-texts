Letter from major-general Wauchope to George Clarke, secretary-at- war.
Sir, —My **lord Lucan** told me you were desirous to have the reasons for our capitulation, which I send you here enclosed.


I could be glad to serve you in a greater matter, for that I am with all sincerity imaginable, sir, your most humble servant, —Jo: Wauchope. —Limerick, 18th October, 1691. —Endorsed: Received at Kilkenny, 22nd October, 1691.The reasons the French general gave **major-general Wauchope** and *Sarsfield* **lord Lucan** for the capitulation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Mr. Clifford** having suffered the enemy to make a bridge upon the river **Shannon** *see [ A Jacobite Narrative] p. 171*, gave them thereby an entry into the county of **Clare**, which was almost the only place we had to subsist the horse and dragoons, the want of forage in the town having hindered us to bring in the horse and dragoons into the town; and the enemy having on the second of October passed to the county of **Clare** with the greatest part of their troops, the ruin of them was inevitable, as well by the great number of the enemy that would have fought them, as by the want of provisions, so as the horse and dragoons must capitulate or disperse.

p.311


The question men made *was*, whether **France** could send horse and dragoons enough to make us keep the country that is so ruined, and desolate that half the flesh necessary for the support of the garrison of **Limerick**, that is nothing but the ruins of a town, could not be drawn from the country.


We should want bread *on* the fifteenth of October, and we expected none from any part of the country, and we had no news that the convoy from **France** was parted from **Brest**; and if it were come to the mouth of the river of **Limerick** we could not hope to be able to make use of the bread before the last of the month of October, even if the French fleet had burnt the English fleet then in the river, and passed all the batteries the enemies might make of both sides of the river.


All these reasons maturely examined made us desire **general Ginkel** to let us retire into **France** with such of the troops as had a mind to go, being assured of the greatest number of them; having no troops to establish the king but by going into **France**, there to make the war, being not able to make it here. And if we had stayed to the last day of our food we could not obtain any capitulation, and the enemy might thereby have our troops; whereas now, by passing them into **France**, we may be in a condition not only to oppose the Common enemy, but also to make a descent into **England** or **Scotland**, if it pleased God to give the French fleet such a victory over the enemy's fleet as it had last campaign.
