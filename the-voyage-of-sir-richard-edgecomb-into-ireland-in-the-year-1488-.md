and incontinent upon hys comyng he sent the Busshopp of Meath, the Baron of Slane, with dyvers othirs in ther Company
to the seyd Sir Richard Edgecomb, and from his Lodging conveyed hym wher the seyd Erle lay, and in a gret
Chamber the seyd Erle receaved and welcomed the seyd Sir Richard. Howbeit the same Sir Richard made not 
Reverence and courtesy to hym, nor to the Lordes ther assemblid, and ther openly deliverid to the seyd Erle the 
Kyng's Letters, the which by hym read and seen, both the seyd Erle, and the seyd Sir Richard, with all the
Lordes went into a privy Chambir, and ther the seyd Sir Richard opened and declarid unto theme his Message that
he had unto theme from the Kyng's Grace, and the cause of his comying. And because that dyverse Lordes of the
Councill of the Lond were not ther present, nor come nigh to these Parts, they took respite for five Days to give answer therunto; 
and that Night the seyd Erle departid to a Place of his called Maynoth, ten Miles from Dublyn, and the seyd Sir Richard went to his Lodgings.


13. Item, Sonday the seyd Sir Richard went to the high
Church of Dublyn, callid Christ's Church, and causid the Busshopp of Meath ther to declare as well the Pope's Bull

Lond, and had gret Communications amongst themeselves. Howbeit that Day Nothing was done, that the seyd Sir

Sir Richard.


16. Item, Wednesday, The seyd Sir Richard always looking that the seyd Erle wuld have done as was agreed
over Night, yet notwithstanding the same Erle and his councill made and fayned unreasonable delays, so that Nothing that the seyd Sir Richard came for was done;

by the Kyng's Laws: But in no wise they wuld agree or assent to the bond of Misi [8](javascript:footNote('E480001-001/note008.html')); and for this bond certen of the seyd Councill came three or four Tymes that Day
to the seyd Sir Richard Edgecomb in his Lodging, and requyred hym to leave off calling for the seyd Bond, whych
he wuld in no wise do, but gave short Answears, with right fell and angry Words; and that Day no Conclusion
was takin. Also the same Day the Lord of Gormanstown dined with the seyd Sir Richard in his Lodging.


18. Item, The seyd Erle and Councill assemblid again
at the seyd Place; and that Day at Afternoon gave unto the said Sir Richard plain Answear, that they wuld in no
wise be bound in the seyd bond of Misi, and rather than they wuld do it, they wuld become Irish every of them.
The seyd Sir Richard hearing, that the common Voice was in the Citty of Dublyn, and all the Country ther abouts, 
that the Kyng of Scotts was Dead, and thereby callid

Lordes graunted to certifie unto the King's Grace under ther Seals, and offerid then to have be Sworn that Day
at Aftirnoon; wherunto the seyd Sir Richard wuld in no wise agree for many causes, but wuld have theme to be 
Sworn on the Forenoon; and that a Chaplain of his own shuld Consecrate the same Host, on whych the seyd Erle
and Lordes shuld be Sworn; and so diferred the taking of their Ooths unto the next Daye; and this Day at Night 
the Threasorer of Irlaund, and the Lord of Gormanstown supped with Sir Richard Edgecomb.


21. Item, The seyd Sir Richard at the Desire of the
seyd Erle went to the Monastry of St. Thomas the Martyr,

and therfor the seyd Sir Richard hitherto refused

causid the Master and Marriners to Traverse in the Sea
Homeward; and with great Pain that Day came against a
Rock called Tulskerd, and there lay at Anchor all that Night
in the open Sea, and the Wind Blew right sore, and was
right troublous Weather.


7. Item, The Wind came reasonably large; and that
day the seyd Sir Richard sayled until he came open uppon
St. Ives in Cornwall; and because the Wind fell open, the
Master and Marriners durst not adventure to pass by the 
gret and perillous Jopardies at the Lands end; and therfore all that Night they traversed in the Sea, and that
Night many sudden showers and Winds fell.


8. Item, The Wind and the Sea being troublous, Sir
Richard and his Skips came into the haven of Fowey, and
there he Landid, and went on Pilgrimage to a chappell
of St. Saviour; and that Night all his company Landid.
