### The Grey Rock: Author: William Butler Yeats

p.3


1. Poets with whom I learned my trade,
  
Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,
  
Here's an old story I've re-made,
  
Imagining 'twould better please
  
Your ears than stories now in fashion,
  
Though you may think I waste my breath
  
Pretending that there can be passion
  
That has more life in it than death,
  
And though at bottling of your wine
  
The bow-legged Goban had no say;
  
The moral's yours because it's mine.
2. When cups went round at close of day—
  
Is not that how good stories run?—
  
Somewhere within some hollow hill,


---

p.4


If books speak truth in Slievenamon,
  
But let that be, the gods were still
  
And sleepy, having had their meal,
  
And smoky torches made a glare
  
On painted pillars, on a deal
  
Of fiddles and of flutes hung there
  
By the ancient holy hands that brought them
  
From murmuring Murias, on cups—
  
Old Goban hammered them and wrought them,
  
And put his pattern round their tops
  
To hold the wine they buy of him.
  
But from the juice that made them wise
  
All those had lifted up the dim
  
Imaginations of their eyes,
  
For one that was like woman made
  
Before their sleepy eyelids ran
  
And trembling with her passion said,
  
'Come out and dig for a dead man,
  
Who's burrowing somewhere in the ground,


---

p.5


And mock him to his face and then
  
Hollo him on with horse and hound,
  
For he is the worst of all dead men.'
3. We should be dazed and terror-struck,
  
If we but saw in dreams that room,
  
Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck
  
That emptied all our days to come.
  
I knew a woman none could please,
  
Because she dreamed when but a child
  
Of men and women made like these;
  
And after, when her blood ran wild,
  
Had ravelled her own story out,
  
And said, 'In two or in three years
  
I need must marry some poor lout,'
  
And having said it burst in tears.
  
Since, tavern comrades, you have died,
  
Maybe your images have stood,
  
Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,
  
Before that roomful or as good.
  
You had to face your ends when young—
  
'Twas wine or women, or some curse—


---

p.6


But never made a poorer song
  
That you might have a heavier purse,
  
Nor gave loud service to a cause
  
That you might have a troop of friends.
  
You kept the Muses' sterner laws,
  
And unrepenting faced your ends,
  
And therefore earned the right—and yet
  
Dowson and Johnson most I praise—
  
To troop with those the world's forgot,
  
And copy their proud steady gaze.
4. 'The Danish troop was driven out
  
Between the dawn and dusk,' she said;
  
'Although the event was long in doubt,
  
Although the King of Ireland's dead
  
And half the kings, before sundown
  
All was accomplished.'
5. 'When this day
  
Murrough, the King of Ireland's son,
  
Foot after foot was giving way,


---

p.7


He and his best troops back to back
  
Had perished there, but the Danes ran,
  
Stricken with panic from the attack,
  
The shouting of an unseen man;
  
And being thankful Murrough found,
  
Led by a footsole dipped in blood
  
That had made prints upon the ground,
  
Where by old thorn trees that man stood;
  
And though when he gazed here and there,
  
He had but gazed on thorn trees, spoke,
  
'Who is the friend that seems but air
  
And yet could give so fine a stroke?'
  
Thereon a young man met his eye,
  
Who said, 'Because she held me in
  
Her love, and would not have me die,
  
Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,
  
And pushing it into my shirt,
  
Promised that for a pin's sake,
  
No man should see to do me hurt;
  
But there it's gone; I will not take


---

p.8


The fortune that had been my shame
  
Seeing, King's son, what wounds you have.'
  
'Twas roundly spoke, but when night came
  
He had betrayed me to his grave,
  
For he and the King's son were dead.
  
I'd promised him two hundred years,
  
And when for all I'd done or said—
  
And these immortal eyes shed tears—
  
He claimed his country's need was most,
  
I'd save his life, yet for the sake
  
Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.
  
What does he care if my heart break?
  
I call for spade and horse and hound
  
That we may harry him.' Thereon
  
She cast herself upon the ground
  
And rent her clothes and made her moan:
  
'Why are they faithless when their might
  
Is from the holy shades that rove


---

p.9


The grey rock and the windy light?
  
Why should the faithfullest heart most love
  
The bitter sweetness of false faces?
  
Why must the lasting love what passes,
  
Why are the gods by men betrayed!
6. But thereon every god stood up
  
With a slow smile and without sound,
  
And stretching forth his arm and cup
  
To where she moaned upon the ground,
  
Suddenly drenched her to the skin;
  
And she with Goban's wine adrip,
  
No more remembering what had been,
  
Stared at the gods with laughing lip.
7. I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,
  
To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,
  
And the world's altered since you died,
  
And I am in no good repute


---

p.10


With the loud host before the sea,
  
That think sword strokes were better meant
  
Than lover's music—let that be,
  
So that the wandering foot's content.
