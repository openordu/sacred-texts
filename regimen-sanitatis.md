### Foreword to the Digital Edition


This digital edition of the Regimen Sanitatis, edited by H. Cameron Gillies, and published 1911 by Glasgow University Press, is the first Irish medical text published by the Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT) on the Internet.


It is based on British Library MS Add. 15582 and was copied in 1563 by Aodh Ó Cendamhain whose scribal signature is on f. 11rbz. Professor Aoibheann Nic Dhonnchadh has pointed out to me that 'there were at least three scribes, Aodh Ó Cendamain, Cairbre, and Daibhí Ó Cearnaigh', and that there is no certainty if Aodh copied the whole text, until the distribution of MS hands is re-examined again.


Gillies' edition was chosen for various reasons: It touches on the interconnections between the Gaelic world of Ireland and Scotland with continental science and scholarship in that pivotal transition period from the late Middle Ages to the emerging Renaissance. It throws light on the process of transmitting, translating and adapting Latin medical tracts into a West European vernacular, undertaken by hereditary physicians from medical schools. It is of interest for the social history of the era, of great interest for lexicography, and it is one of the few edited texts of this vast manuscript body. Moreover, Gillies' edition is in the public domain.


In the printed edition, Gillies' transliteration is accompanied by reproductions of the MS, described by him as ‘quite legible’ (p. 1). There are no digital images of this MS available yet, but digital images of a late 15th century or early 16th century vellum manuscript containing the same text, National Library of Ireland G 12, are available on the ISOS Project website: http://www.isos.dcu.ie/nli/home.html).


In preparing the edition, our intention has been to make the major part of the text available, including introduction, transliteration, translation, and editor's notes. The /SGML/XML master file contains structural and content encoding (regularized forms, corrections, deletions, etc.). From the master document a number of smaller files and a single file containing the whole text in HTML format are derived for display in web browsers. The single HTML file contains markedly less encoding than the master file. The HTML file is the basis for the plaintext format, which in turn is stripped of all encoding and notes. There is a small number of Greek characters and apothecaries' symbols, such as 'ounce', 'dragma' and 'scruple' which, regrettably, are not supported yet and cannot be displayed.


CELT is switching from SGML to XML as its markup language. There are far-reaching implications for text processing and display quality:


 (1) XML supports all unicode characters; (2) conversion of text to static HTML versions, and the related loss of encoded information will be a thing of the past. The XML master file will be underlying source for creating HTML files 'on the fly' each time a page is loaded in the browser. An XSLT stylesheet acts as intervening instance controlling the manner in which the underlying information is transformed into HTML. It is possible, with multiple XSLT stylesheets for the same master document, to create customised HTML versions, for instance one showing the transcribed text, and another showing the edited text. In the case of variant readings (which we do not have for this edition) there could be an XSLT stylesheet showing the different readings of each manuscript separately.


The transliteration was left as it is apart from slight editorial changes. These include capitalizing proper names, and providing regularized name forms using the *reg* attribute inside the *name* markup for easier searching.


Gillies' rendering of expressions such as 'dothabhairt', 'gominic', 'afhis', 'intan', etc. was brought in line with general usage by writing them separately. The forms used by Gillies in the edition are retained in the master file in the 'reg' (regularization) tag which has an 'orig' (original) attribute: *reg orig="gominic"*go minic*/reg*. An unexpected difficulty presented itself in cases where his rendering in the *orig* tag differed from the MS original, whether through MS misreadings or typographical errors.


Gillies' remarks on letters marked by the 'punctum delens', and his notes dealing with textual emendations are integrated into the encoding. His other notes are integrated into the main text, and displayed as popup windows in the HTML file (such as the note to col. 17 l. 32; col. 20 l. 9, l. 24; col. 26 l. 31). A few notes not containing relevant material were omitted, such as col. 19 l. 9, col. 17, l. 26; and 'Further Notes' under col. 29.) Readers will note that the spelling of words and phrases in the notes sometimes differs from that shown in the transliteration: such as col.7 t'singcoipis(n) — tshingcoipis(t); col.8 fundamínt(n) — fundamint(t); col.9 caindighect na nithead(n) — caindighecht na neithead(t); col.10 linadh tadhbais(n) — línadh tadhbais(t), foirbhearteos, to name but a few. Overall, he tends to expand the many MS abbreviations of the Early Modern Irish manuscript in the Scottish Gaelic manner.


In cross-references within his notes, he refers to column and line of the manuscript. Since the digital edition allows text search, this should not present any problem.


Gillies himself calls his translation 'stilted', but very literal, as ‘the diction of the old medical Empirics [...] is [...] in concept wholly unintelligible to the mind of the present day’ (13) and he perceives an ‘immeasurable and irreconcileable difference between the Gaelic and the English idioms’ (14). His aim has been ‘to conserve as much of the flavour of the original’ (14) as possible.


Finally it is my pleasure to record my thanks to Professor Aoibheann Nic Dhonnchadh from the School of Celtic Studies, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, for reading the SGML file, and for her generous and invaluable help in correcting errors, and offering suggestions to improve this edition.

### Introduction


This tract Regimen Sanitatis or the Rule of Health is from a Gaelic Medical Manuscript which I found at the British Museum. The MS. (catalogued as Add. 15582) consists of sixty-two vellum folios, the same size as is here reproduced. The cover is skin-covered board ornamented by simple straight-line devices. The front board has two sides of the original pair of silver clasps still attached, the other parts are wanting. The vellum is in a very fair state of preservation, and the writing, as may be seen from the photographic reproduction, is quite legible. Without doubt this book belonged to **John MacBeath**, one of the very remarkable family of that name who were hereditary physicians to the Lords of the Isles and to the Kings of Scotland for several centuries. The volume remained in the **MacBeath** family for many generations, but how it found its way into England, I fear, cannot now be surely known. The only indication is that it was ‘purchased of **Thos. Rodd** 9th August 1845’ — by the Museum — but how it came into **Rodd**'s hands is not known. There is another MacBeath book also lying here (catalogued as Add. 15403), a smaller vellum treating of **Materia Medica**. It also was got through **Rodd**, a well-known London bookseller who took up his father's business in 1821, and died 1849. In this volume, on inserted paper leaves in the front, occur these statements: (1) ‘Presented by **Sir Wm. Betham** [to the Duke of Sussex?] May 24th 1827 — MS. on Botany in the Irish character’; (2) ‘Purchased at the Sussex Sale 31st July 1844 by **Thorpe** and of him (through **Rodd**) for B.M. 10 Aug. 1845.’ It is very likely that the two volumes came by the same way, so

far. **Sir Wm. Betham** was Keeper of the Records of Dublin Castle from 1805 onwards until he was made Ulster King of Arms in 1820. He was devoted to philology and to the Gaelic language especially, and wrote extensively upon Keltic subjects. He died at Blackrock near Dublin in 1853. The **Duke of **Sussex**** (1773-1846) was sixth son of George III. and a president of the Royal Society.


### The Macbeaths


The only methodical attempts as yet made to endeavour to get the long history of this family into anything like order have been (1) by **Professor Mackinnon** in two valuable articles written to the Edinburgh Medical Journal in 1896, (2) by myself in an essay written for the **Caledonian Medical Society** in 1902, published in the Society's Journal for April of that year, and (3) by **Professor Mackinnon** again upon ‘The Genealogy of the MacBeths or Beatons of Islay and Mull’, which was published in the same Journal ( C.M.J.) in July of the same year. I here summarise these efforts, and try to get them into such order as I may be able to — with any additional facts I may have lately culled. This will give a more direct and intelligent interest to the text than could be possible without it. It will also serve as a basis for further investigation and addition.


The name MacBeath (as I here prefer it) is very variously written in the old manuscripts and in books. It is Mac-bead, Book of Deer 11th cent., M'Betha 1408, Beatone 1511, Meg Beth 1563, Micbhethadh 1587, MacBeath 1609, Beatoun 1638, M'Bethadh 1657, Betonus 1674, Bettounus 1677, Beda 1680 — but older far — Maigbheta 1701, Maig Bhetha 1708. In the MSS. of the Advocates' Library the dates of which are not yet fixed, it occurs as Betune II, Meigbetadh IV, Maigbheta V, Magbeta XX, Makbetathe, M'Veagh Beattoun and Beattounne XXI. It has become Peudan (Peden) in Skye and Biotun in Mull. Bethune also occurs associated with the MacBeaths, but as this

family is said to have come from Fife it is doubtful if they were at all related in name or blood. There may have been an overlapping or an intermixture of the names, but the basic name is that given.


The true forms of the family name, such as Bead, Beda, Macbheatha and Macbheathadh, mean ‘Son of life’, following a very old form of Gaelic naming, perhaps the oldest, many others of which remain with us to the present day.


Other important facts relating to this family are, in — 


1379. Farquhar (medicus regis) had a grant from **Prince Alexander Stuart (The Wolf of Badenoch)** of the lands of Melness and Hope, and in — 


1386. Ferchard Leiche, ‘Farquhar the physician’, got in heritage from **King Robert II.** the islands of Jura, Calwa, Sanda, Ellangawne, Ellanwillighe, Ellanrone, Ellanehoga, Ellanequochra, Ellanegelye, Ellaneyefe, and all the islands between Rowestorenastynghe and Rowearmadale — Rudh' a' Stóir an Assaint and Rudh' Armadail.


1408. Fercos Macbetha witnesses, and almost certainly draws, a deed of land-grant in Islay to **Brian Vicaire Mhag-aodh** from **McDomhnaill** — the Macdonald of the Isles who led the Highlanders at the battle of Harlaw, 24th July, 1411. His father, **John, Lord of the Isles**, was married to **Lady Margaret Stuart, daughter of Robert II.** This deed is reproduced in Nat. MSS. Scot. Vol. ii. No. lix., and in The Book of Islay, and in the C.M.J. for April, 1902. The lands here granted are situated in the Oa extending across from Kilneachtoin to Laggan Bay.


1511. **Donold M'Donachy or M'Corrachie** (simply the same name mis-written because most likely mis-spoken), ‘descendit frae Farquhar Leiche’, resigned the lands of Melness and Hope and all the lands of Strathnaver, in favour of the Chief of the Mackays. Donnachadh (Duncan) was a favourite name with the **MacBeaths**, and the M'Donachy, M'Corrachie (for MacDhonnachaidh) and the Connachers of Lorn are one and the same name. Donchad M'Meic Bead occurs in The Book of Deer.

p.4


**Duncan Conacher** wrote a medical work at Dunollie in this same year, which is still extant.


In 1511 a **David Beatone** was among the Nomina incorporatorum of the University of Glasgow, and from that time onwards through three centuries the Roll contains such names as **Johannus Beatonus**, **Fergus Betonius**, **Duncan Beatonus**, **Donaldus Beatonus**, etc.


1563. Another Tract of this same MS., mostly surgical, was written for **John MacBeath** by **David O'Kearny**. It was published, C.M.J. April, 1902.


1587. Under this date there is a Gaelic entry in the Laing MS. (Adv. xxi.) that the book then belonged to **Gilcolum son of Gilanders son of Donald MacBeath**.


In Adv. iii. (which I have at the B.M., by the courtesy of the Directors, for the purpose of reference) there occurs on the second folio from the end, in the top margin, ‘Misi Gilla Col*aim* I am Gilla-colum’.


1598. The MS. was in possession of **James MacBeath** at Tain. It was evidently lent him by John, the real owner, whose mother had in that year made a journey to Islay. — C.M.J.


1609. **James VI.** confirms to **Fergus M'Beath** by charter certain lands in the Oa of Islay which his family had held from the Lords of the Isles in virtue of their office as hereditary physicians ‘ab omni hominum memoria’. The full text of the charter is given in the C.M.J.


1629. These lands were sold by **John the son of Fergus** to the **Lord Lorne** of the time and the charter found its way to Inveraray, where it is preserved.


1638. A **James Betoun**, ‘doctor of physicke’, made a ‘voyage’ from Edinburgh to Islay professionally twice, as would seem, in this year. In the Accounts of Colin and George Campbell — brothers and
curators successively of **John Campbell Fiar of Calder** (1638-1653) — there appears an item of payment to the said James of £266 13s. 4d. for his first journey ‘as his ticket of reseate bearis’, and of £178 8s. for the second, and a further

1657. John, a distinguished member of the Mull branch — the famous **Ollamh Muileach**, died. He was buried in Iona, where **Donald Beaton** in 1674 placed a slab to his memory bearing the inscription Joannes Betonus, Maclenorum familie medicus qui mortuus est 19 Novembris 1657.


1671. ‘**Ioannus Bettonnus**’ possessed the MS. Adv. iii., for he says ‘egrape to cheir autón’, 1671, evidently intended to mean 'written with his own hand', and E M'B appears in a small circular mended patch on the inside of the cover.


1700. Martin wrote his Travels, where he makes interesting references to the **Beatons**. He states among other things that ‘Dr. Beaton the famous physician of Mull’ was sitting on the upper deck of the Florida, one of the vessels of the Spanish Armada, when it was blown up in the bay of Tobermory in 1588, but that he escaped unhurt.

### The Substance of the Text


Even if this book may not add very much to the sum of our present medical knowledge it is nevertheless of extreme interest from the human and historical aspect as well as from the point of view of the physician and the scholar. To find men in the far North and in the Western Isles of Scotland who, in those early centuries, were familiar with, and had well digested all that was best in the medical literature of Greece and Rome and Araby is more than, let us say, **Lord Macaulay** would give them credit for; and it would surely surprise **Samuel Johnson** to find that there was a great mass of Gaelic scientific writing lying unknown, for long ages, before he declared that there was not one page in the language beyond a hundred years old. It was so, however, even if **Dr. Johnson** did not know, and even if **Lord Macaulay** to his utter discredit did not want to.


The generalisations of the first chapter are so completely comprehensive and yet so extremely precise and logical, that we may doubt if they have ever been, or can be, improved upon. Conservatiuum, Preservatiuum, and Reductiuum round the whole duty of man regarding his health in the most perfect way, and perhaps in the very best form of words. Conservatiuum is the duty of those in health; or, as we might say, an intelligent understanding of the conditions of health and life, and a rightly careful application of this most useful and saving knowledge, to conserve the healthful state, is the first and highest duty of everyone. That is what Conservation means, or as **Dr. Standish O'Grady** has put it with almost a stroke of genius, ‘Keep as you are’.


Preservatiuum, again, is for those who know by any signs that they are departing from the fully healthy state and are going into unhealth and weakness ‘that is proper and necessary’ for them, and very urgently so, if they are to save themselves from a much worse state.

p.7


Reductiuum is for those who, failing to apply their common sense in the earlier, easier positions, must now be led back, through suffering and sorrow and loss and expense, the same way as that by which they ignorantly or foolishly came down — back to and through the Preservatiuum or ‘fore-seeing’ position where they could have saved themselves before, and up to the position at which Conservatiuum would have made their decline and dis-ease impossible — that is, if they ever get back there again. How very often do we hear a man say, ‘Since that last illness, I have not been myself at all; I find I must be careful now.’ This is the very essence of wisdom, but it has been dearly bought — perfection through suffering surely, for very much less 'care' at the proper time would have saved him from the whole catastrophe. Much more rarely we hear, ‘Since that last illness I have been a new man.’ This simply means that a man who has been drawing too much upon his life and health has been ‘pulled up’, and through long and careful Reductio he has been led back fortunately to his first position of apparently good health. Conservatiuum is the position for thoughtful, sensible men. Preservatiuum is the position at which natural warnings show themselves and should be understood and obeyed. Reductiuum is the whip-lash of compulsion which comes really to save and not to destroy, but which even in the best event can only attain, through suffering and sore uphill travail, to the position of less or more of the health which with some sense should never have been lost or departed from.


The sensefulness of this single chapter alone, if people would only understand and act upon it, would fully justify the labour and expense entailed by this work, apart altogether from its aim in other directions.


I do not analyse the contents of the Tract. It will reveal itself. It is full of wisdom — the filtrate, so to say, of a thousand years of very clear thought, and the essence of writings that are permanent. The very admirable morning ‘toilet’ of the Third Chapter is, however, commended to the attention

of such as perhaps may be disposed to believe **Lord Macaulay**'s gross travesty of the personal habits of his own people. We must remember that this was before the advent of the household bath and the tooth-brush. It is therefore a very excellent and very wholesome direction, indeed.


### The Genesis of the Book


**John MacBeath** (and I here use his name as representative of the whole family, others of them doubtless contributing also) kept a Note Book, a **Vade Mecum**, in which he stored the sum and essence of his reading, compiled and translated from the many ancient authors which we know he had in his possession. He added pertinent comments and observations of his own, based upon his necessarily wide experience. All this was set down in the Scottish Gaelic of the time, which really did not differ very much from the Irish language of the same period. The compilation was not intended for publication, but was simply a practical memoriola such as many thoughtful physicians keep even in our day and place, when it is not nearly so necessary as it was in the **MacBeaths**' time and circumstances. He gave his manuscripts over to a professional Irish scribe in order that the substance might be written in the best and most compact form, and that is how we have them now. This Tract was written by **Aodh O'Cendainn**, as is shown in the last line of column xiv. of the text. A **Cairpre O'Cendamhainn** wrote at least part of the Laing MS. (Adv. xxi.). These may have been brothers. A similar thing happens in the case of another Tract in this same book which was written by two O'Kearneys — **David** and **Cairpre** (C.M.J. April, 1902). That these men were mere copyists knowing little or nothing of Medicine or its terminology is abundantly evident from the numerous miswritings that occur throughout all their work. It is also clear that they had their materials before them in Scottish Gaelic form, because we frequently find that when they take their eye off the ‘copy’ they


---

p.9




at once drift into the writing of Irish forms — especially of the smaller commoner words.


The MacBeath knowledge by reading seems to have included all the best that was available in their time. Martin ‘Gent’, himself a man of Skye, the interesting, observant, and very intelligent traveller, writing in 1700, states that ‘**Fergus Beaton** in South Uist possessed the following MSS., namely **Avicenna**, **Averroes**, **Joannes de Vigo**, **Bernardus Gordonus**, and several volumes of **Hippocrates**.’ These names and many others of the medical classics meet us constantly in the MacBeath writings. John might have sat for his portrait to **Chaucer** of his ‘Doctour of Phisik’ in the fourteenth century, for


> 1. Wel knewe he the olde Esculapius
>   
> And Dioscorides and eke Rufus,
>

>   
> Serapion, Razis and Avycen,
>   
> Averrois, Damascien and Constantyn,
>   
> Bernard and Gatesden and Gilbertyn.
> 




It will be helpful to understand the remoter origins. ‘Peritisimus omnium rerum Ippocras’ says the postscript, column xxviii, and we may trace from this point and by this way the history of medical knowledge more directly and more appreciably than by any other path. To **Hippocrates**, **Aristotle**, and **Galen**, and the whole immense power of the Greek intellect, medicine was always a close branch of philosophy. It is not so with us now, but not long hence it must surely be so again.


The disturbing but awakening power of the Macedonian conqueror led to the founding of Alexandria and its great University. This was a University in the truest sense, for it was international and catholic without restraint. It had no test but knowledge and ability. Gentile, Jew, and Christian were alike equal. From this great centre through commercial and intellectual contact the Greek philosophy spread into Arabia and Persia and as far as India, and it had a further disseminating impulse from the banishment of the ‘heathen’ philosophers by


---

p.10




the first Justinian in the year 529. The effect was that a blaze of intellectual culture broke out and possessed the East for five hundred years. The great Greek writers were studied, translated, and commented to an altogether wonderful extent. It was in this way that came **Janus Damascenus**, the Commentator of our text, and **Isaac Judaeus**
 and **Rhases** and **Avicenna**, **Hali**, **Averrhoes**, **Rufus** and many others.


In the early part of the present millennium there came a great return wave which struck along the northern coasts of the Mediterranean, where many schools of learning were founded upon the Arabian models, and were greatly influenced by Arabian teachers. Of these **Monte-Casino**, **Salerno**, and **Montpellier** were the most famous.


The monastery of **Monte-Casino**, nearly half-way between Naples and Rome, was founded by **St. Benedict** himself A.D. 529, as is said upon the old site of a temple of **Apollo**. Centuries later with the return of learning an infirmary was added and a school of medicine.


Monks from foreign lands came there for instruction, and eminent invalids from foreign parts for treatment. The most famous teacher of the School was **Constantinus Africanus of **Carthage**** (1018–1087). He introduced Arabic science and learning into Italy and Europe, and because of his universal travel and influence he was called ‘Orientis et Occidentis Doctor’. He taught for some time at Salerno, and then became monk at **Monte-Casino**, where he continued his work of translating from Arabic into Latin. Among his works of this kind was **Hali**'s compendium, which he rendered under the title of Pantegni. It is frequently referred to in our text.


**Salerno** (old Salernum) on the bay of the same name, some thirty miles south of Naples, was founded as a school of Philosophy and Medicine A.D. 1150, and was for five hundred years at the top of medical schools in Europe. It was for this reason that it was nick-named ‘Civitas Hippocratica’. It was a practical University, studying the symptoms of disease, diet, **materia medica**,

p.11




and treatment in its fullest expression — not giving much attention to physiology or anatomy. The school had a very excellent effect in that its teaching mitigated and naturalised the rather severe doctrines of the older Greek methods of treatment; and this, without doubt, came by Arabic influence. Two great and permanent works issued from this school, namely, the Compendium Salernitatum and the rhymed Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. The former was a composite treatise, the text-book of the school, of which **Joannes Platearius** was part author. His part of the Compendium is the basis of the other MacBeath MS. (Add. 15403) in the British Museum *(now British Library)*. The other work is a poem, or rather a versification, the object of which was that the wisdom it conveyed could be more easily committed to, and retained in the memory. It was addressed to **Robert, son of William the Conqueror**, ‘Anglorum Regi’, who was cured of a wound at **Salerno** in the year 1101. This was the **vade mecum** of every well-educated physician in Europe for several centuries. **Sylvius**, in his edition of the Schola Salernitana (Rotterdam, 1649), says ‘Nullus medicorum est qui carmina Scholae Salernitanae ore non circumfiret et omni occasione non crepet.’ This work is attributed to **John of Milan**, who was President of **Salerno** in his day, but the Address is from ‘Schola tota Salerni’. That the book was in the possession of the **MacBeaths** there can be no doubt at all, so that if we owe the form of our text to **John of Gaddesden** we are indebted to the ancient School of Salernum for its substance and its whole essential character — not forgetting how much the MacBeaths themselves have added to it. The following quotation from the Regimen, if compared with the burden of the text, will readily show the pertinence of the statement which I have just made.

**Montpellier**, the chief town of the province of Herault in Southern France on the Gulf of Lyons, was, like Salerno, a school of general learning, with Medicine as perhaps its highest feature. The University was established by papal bull in 1289; the sexcentenary was celebrated in 1890. **Gilbert the Englishman** was taught here, as was also **John of Gaddesden**, the author of the Rosa Anglica, upon part of which our Text is based. **Bernard Gordon** also, a Scot born in France, was a teacher here in the early years of the fourteenth century. He wrote the Lilium Medicinae which the **MacBeaths** possessed and rendered into Gaelic. A copy of this work was presented to the library of the **Society of Scottish Antiquaries** in 1784, where it now lies. It came from **Farchar Beaton of Husabost** ‘five generations ago’ — according to the **Rev. Donald Macqueen of **Kilmuir**** who presented the book.


**Montpellier** was strongly under the Arabic influence, which explains how we find so many Arabic terms in such of our Manuscripts as came by this way — especially in the names of medicinal plants and in **Materia Medica** generally.


This very short statement of the old Schools taken with the Personal Notes will enable the reader to understand the history of the Text fairly well.

### The Transliteration


The extension of the Text which is arranged to face the photographs is as correct and exact as it possibly can be made. I have copied the errors of the scribe with even more care than the correct writing. I am exceedingly indebted to my affectionate friend **Standish H. O'Grady, LL. D.** — a Grádhach truly in act as in name. He compared my rendering of the MS. with the original, ‘letter for letter’ as he expressed it — yes, and dot for dot. This exact rendering will make the text much more valuable from the scholar's point of view, and to the student it will be always of interest to observe the many difficulties and the very frequent pitfalls which the pioneer in this kind of work had to overcome and to avoid.


I have not brought the various Contractions together in one place as might have been done. I thought it would be sufficient to refer to them, as they occurred, in the Notes. In my Essay, which is deposited at the Library of the **Society of Scottish Antiquaries**, there are some ten pages of the contractions given, and a special page is given to the more important in the Caledonian Medical Journal for April, 1902. The novice, however, in this study will do well to make a list of them for himself; it will be easy to do so with the extension facing the original MS. writing.


### The Translation


The English rendering of the Text is very stilted — for several reasons. The diction of the old Medical Empirics which occupies the great part of the earlier chapters, and colours all the others, however simple the words may appear, is yet in concept wholly unintelligible to the mind of the present day. All that could be done then was to give a rigidly literal but naked translation. Then again, there is the immeasureable and


---

p.14




irreconcileable difference between the Gaelic and the English idioms. An English rendering can therefore only be a very crude compromise. I have endeavoured to conserve as much of the flavour of the original as I possibly could, and yet bring as much of the sense within the English language as makes it fairly easy to follow — with a little thought and attention.


### The Time and Age of the Text


This can be arrived at, but at best only approximately, by the following ways, namely:
1. By the earliest expressed date given in, or as part of, the Text. We find in this same MS., and in what would seem to be a later tract than that of our Text, ‘Ocus do bi aois an tigerna antan do sgriobhadh an leabar so .i. mile bliadan ocus cuig céd ocus tri bliadna ocus tri fithid and the age of the Lord the time this book was written was one thousand years and five hundred and three years and three score — 1563.’
  

It is not drawing too much upon possibility nor even upon probability if we give our Text a century of existence as the handbook of the **MacBeath** family before it was given by this **John** to the Irish scribe **O'Cendainn** to copy, or the other and later tract to the **O'Kearneys**.
2. The form and style of the handwriting is another aid, but still only approximately. The writing of 
Leabhar na hUidhre in its contractions and other graphical peculiarities does not differ very strongly from our Text, and its date is taken as fixed — about 1470. The same may be said of 
The Book of Lismore, and it is accepted as being of the latter part of the fifteenth century. This also is in confirmation of my deduction so far.
3. Then there is the developmental stage of the language to be considered, and this again in the matter of **Eclipsis** and other grammatical peculiarities, points to the same period.
4. Finally, there is the fact that the Rosa Anglica, upon which our Text is based, was published in the early years of


---

p.15




the fourteenth century; and knowing that the **MacBeaths** took a high place in Medicine long before, and kept it for long after, we cannot imagine that it took more than two hundred years to come to their knowledge. **Dr. O'Grady** thinks the writing is of the early sixteenth century, but the late **Whitley Stokes**, by far the greatest Gaelic scholar of our time and perhaps of all time, placed the companion MS. (15403) as of the early fifteenth or even the fourteenth century. The side-light of **Chaucer**, already, quoted from his ‘Doctour of Phisik’ is also important in this connection, for we can hardly believe that the first physicians of Scotland were far, if at all, behind those of **Chaucer**'s time in England in their knowledge of the authors here so freely referred to.
  

>So, taking all these things into consideration, it does not seem too much to say that our Text is ‘of the Early 16th Century’. I feel that it would be even safer to say the 15th century instead.



The form of the language in the Text is also of interest. If compared with the form of modern Scottish Gaelic, several points come out clearly. First, the root essentials have been, are, and remain the same — always — though other things vary and differ very much. The Eclipsis of the Strong initial Consonants c, p, t and even of the Medials g, b, d which has been so definitely developed in the later Irish language did not belong to the old language at all. It is an effort to follow and to express a physiological actuality but for which expression there is really no linguistic need. We had the process fully developed in our older Scottish Gaelic, but it has most sensibly been done away with altogether, and we have no eclipsis now. In my copy of the Confession of Faith, printed at Glasgow in 1725, such forms as a mbpeacadh ‘the sin’, na ngcriostaidh ‘of the Christians’, na ndtrocair ‘of the mercies’ are met with, where the whole vocal gamut is logically, even if unnecessarily, expressed. The Irish people never went this whole logical length. It was too much to introduce a word by mbp, ngc, ndt — but



---

p.16



they have stuck closely to the two letter forms of initial mb and bp, ng and gc, nd and dt. Eclipsis occurs in our Text, but not regularly and not frequently, so we might fairly infer that the time of our Text was about the time of the introduction of this peculiarity in writing.


The terminal inflections are fairly well preserved, but without precision or regularity — as may be seen. They are carelessly and perhaps ignorantly shown and done; still they are not without interest. As in the matter of eclipsis, there is in these also an apparent seeking after phonetic expression, regardless of the historical continuity of form.


Aspiration of the consonants again is here only partly developed. This is now complete both in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic. The process has certainly deformed written Scottish Gaelic especially, which writes h after the consonant where Irish only uses the very much neater over-dot.


All these expediences follow the ‘otiose’ or lazy development which is manifest in all languages. In fact, as the late **Dr. Macbain** put it to me, it is not unlikely that mankind in days to come may be able to get along with only a few grunts. The tendency is strongly in that direction. The speech of man is losing its bone and its strength, in the same way and perhaps for the same reasons as the race is losing its hair and its teeth — because it does not fully use them.


P.S. — On 13th July, 1641, **William Earl Mareschal** borrowed from **James Beatoune of **Nether Tarbett**, Doctor of Medicine**, and **Janet Goldman**, his spouse, the sum of 4000 merks upon the security of some lands in the parish of **Fetteresso**, for repayment of which and arrears of interest the said **Mr. James Beatoune** raised against the Earl a successful process of apprising on the said lands before the Commissioners for the Administration of Justice on 3rd January, 1654. ( C.M.J., Jan., 1911).


It is surely interesting that where I consulted the Museum authorities as to the best man to photograph this text, they at once said ‘Mr. Macbeth’, and his name is John!

### CHAPTER I.

{MS page/column 1/1}
REGIMEN SANITATIS EST TRIPLEX, that is, there are three aspects of the Regulation of the Health. Conseruatiuum, that is, guarding, *or maintaining the healthy state*; and Preseruatiuum, that is, fore-seeing; and Reductiuum, that is, guiding backwards *restoration* as Galen shows in the third Particle of his Tegni. Conseruatiuum to the healthy men, it is right. Preseruatiuum to those who are going into unhealth and to those of debility, it is a duty. And Reductiuum to such as are in illness, it is necessary. Nevertheless Seruatiuum is called Preseruatiuum sometimes as **Hali** says in the third Particle of his Tegni in the sixth Comment *and* ten and two twenties *the fifty-sixth Comment*. And yet I say that it is from things similar that the conservation is made, as is said in the same place, ‘Si uis conseruare crasim quam accepisti similia similibus offeras’, that is, if you wish the Complexion which thou hast taken to thee to be retained give things similar. And so, it is things similar altogether in degree and in form that should be given to the moderate *abstemious* body; and the body that declines by natural disposition *away* from moderation, things similar should be given to him according to form and not according to degree because of the desire *disposition* he has towards falling as Averrhoes says in the sixth book of Colleget. And if you say that inaction is not taken to him from the similars as Avicenna says in the chapter upon
 {MS page/column 1/2}
the Signs *or indications* of the Complexion in the second Section of the first Book where he says that it is from tota species the members act upon the food, I say that it is from tota species of the member


---

p.32


*the stomach* that digestion is made and from the warmth *heat* as instrument as Averrhoes says in the fifth Book of Colleget regarding the stomach of the bird called Struccio, that more readily *quickly* is the time in which a big *piece of* iron is melted there from tota species than in the fire and so it is in this case. Or I say that similars take no effect in the things that are without life yet they may do well in the things in which there is life. Nevertheless the bodies which decline *depart* from moderation they should be regulated *nourished* by things similar according to form while they are in the moderation which is proper to them, and without being similar as regards degree, for the degree should be lower in the *case of the* food than in *that of* the body if given for its nourishment. And these people should be nourished with healing food, for it is with food that is *really* food the temperate Complexion should be nourished. ‘Uerbi gracia’, that is, **Hali** says in the third Particle of his Tegni commenting *upon* this text ‘Calidiora calidioribus, et cetera’, that it is necessary to cure the warm body or the body which departs from the equableness of its two degrees with things *that are* hot in the first degree. And these are called cold things, for the low heat is 'cold' in the mouth of the physician, and it is therefore that some say wrongly, understanding *interpreting* that text, that it is with cold things the hot bodies ought to be conserved, and that is a lie. Yet it may be prevented *fore-seen* or saved by things{MS page/column 2/3}
with lower degree than the body desired to be preserved. Yet, nevertheless, the regulation *or treatment* which is called Reductio it is with cold things on the contrary *side* and in degree that it should be done *carried out*. Still it should be understood that it is with things hot and low that the hot bodies should be preserved, and the cold bodies with cold *and* low things, and the dry bodies with things dry *and* low — et cetera. And it is evident that those of black humors *of the Melancholic temperament* should be regulated with things cold, dry and low; and these are hot, moist things and not singly


---

p.33




but in compensation for the Complexion of black humor as says Commentator the Damascene in the second Particle *and* in the fifth Comment and three twenties *the sixty-fifth* that the wine is hot and dry yet he says that it is hot and moist in compensation for black humors and so also I say in this case. And so also regarding the cold Complexion *that* it should be regulated with things cold, moist *and* low, and these are hot, dry *and* low things. Yet if a Complexion of white humors *of phlegmatic temperament* has fallen by a hurtful fall towards coldness and moistness it should be regulated *treated* by hot, dry *and* high things — and that is the guiding towards the contrary. Further, these things ought to be studied in order to preserve the health, namely, Appetite *or disposition* and Quantity *of food* and Order and Time of year and the Time or Hour of eating and Age and Habit. And we have said concerning the appetite lately that it should be similar in degree and in form or in form only and not so in degree for as was said at first that low things are similars to the cold Complexion because low hot things are called cold by the physician and the cold is *a* similar to the cold thing; and also everything in which there is life it is hot *[to be so classed]* and it is therefore it should not be understood that the cold things are not similar*s* to the human body but that the cold low things are, and these are hot things {MS page/column 2/4}
in the mouth of the physician.


### THE SECOND CHAPTER — OF THE QUANTITY OF THE FOOD.


The Quantity of the Food, that is, it should be eaten when it is desired, for Aristotle says in Epistula ad Alexandrum, ‘Dum adhuc apetitus durat manum retrahe’, that is withdraw thy hand towards thee and *while* the appetite is *yet* remaining with thee. And Avicenna says in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the things *to be* eaten and drunken *that is Concerning Food and Drink* ‘Ita comede quod sint reliquie


---

p.34




desiderii’, that is, you should so eat that you have a remnant of desire *for more* left, for it is better to multiply the times *to have meals more often* than a great quantity *at one time*. And it is better to eat a little in two times than a great deal at one time because the food that is eaten at one time in large quantity it cannot be digested and it will pervert the power of digestion of the stomach then, and the error *perversion* that is made in the first digestion if *while* it is great is not corrected in the second digestion as Commentor Damasenus says in the first Particle in the sixteenth Comment. And it is therefore that it does not nourish dutifully then. And it is for that reason that Avicenna says in the third Book that the greedy men will not grow. And also the food that is taken in unreasonable quantity it will cause constriction and that is a cause of corruption through the absence of coolness, according to **Hali** in the third Particle of his Tegni. And it is the sign that a person has eaten enough that there comes not from the eating of the meal any increase of the pulse or diminution in the breathing, for this will not happen but because the stomach closes *presses* upon the diaphragm, and it is therefore *because of that* the breath is small *and* frequent, and the need for coolness of the heart causes the pulse to increase, since there is no weakening of *upon* the strength. Other signs are that there is no change upon the *appearance of* the urine nor upon the motions and upon the bowels particularly that hypocondria {MS page/column 3/5}
is not reached *caused* and without suffering cramps or flatulence or heaviness or weakness *faintness* and without sickness *desire to vomit* or apititus caninus *dog-appetite* nor falling *failing* of desire *for food* to be upon him nor laziness of mind, but that he can study after a meal as he did before it, but alone *indeed* while the food falls and the digestion begins, because the offensive *unpraisable* fumes then arise and they cause sleep and prevent study. And further he should be without sleeplessness and he should not have the taste of the food when he eructates — for if these are as we have said it shows that the


---

p.35




food has been moderate in quantity. Yet the habit ought to be considered here, if it is not very bad, as may be seen. And I say also regarding the drink that it should not be in that quantity that the food is a-swim in the stomach as the case is with drunkards. And it is therefore *that* the thing which some say that it is well to get drunk once a month is a lie, as Averrhoes shows in the second Particle of the Canticles in the third Canticle *and* ten over twenty *the thirty-third* where he says ‘assensus ebrietatis simel in mense est erroneus’, that is, it is wrong to agree to the drunkenness one time in the month, for, though of the things which more benefit the natural heat *it is* the wine taken in moderation and of the things that do it harm *to the natural heat* and to the brain and to the senses *it is* it, when it is taken in excess; and it is therefore he says there that the water of honey is better for those who have weak nerves, than it *the wine*. Yet nevertheless a little wine may give comfort to the old men as he says there *in that place*. Yet Avicenna says in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the water and the wine ‘Pueris dare uinum est addere ignem igni in lignis debilibus’, that is, it is *like* putting fire upon the head of fire on weakly wood to give wine to youths. Nevertheless give it in moderation to the young men, and to the *old man* in the quantity he wishes; indeed they ought to have it in good quantity. I say that 
 {MS page/column 3/6}
the quantity he may desire should be given to the old man because of the agedness and that is the moderate old man who will desire as much *only* as he is able to digest and he is a very discreet man. And yet the old man from his very-agedness [166](javascript:footNote('G600010/note166.html')) he should not be given that much, for such people are exhausted and foolish and small is their heat for they are like a lamp ready to drown *go out* as is said in the first Particle of the Aphorisms and it is therefore that Galen says in the same Particle commenting upon this canon ‘Potus indigenciam soluit et cetera’ it is therefore I ask *I question* is it before the meal it should be given or *immediately* after, and it will be seen that not before the meal for 


---

p.36




Avicenna says in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the water and the wine ‘Sapiens debet sibi prohibere ne ieinunus uinum bibat’, that is, the wise man should spare himself from drinking wine upon first eating and it should not be given after the meal for Avicenna says in the same chapter ‘Uinum post quod libet omnium ciborum est malum’, that is, the wine is bad after every meal *or, food*; and he says in the chapter which regulates the thing eaten and drunken ‘Uinum post cibum est ex rebus magis impedientibus digestionenm’, that is, of the things which more greatly prevent the digestion *is* the wine drunk after food, because it makes the food bore *pass out of the stomach* before it is digested. And the wine upon the meal is not proper, according to Avicenna in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the things eaten and drunken where he says ‘Oportet ut post comestionem bibat quis et non in hora comedendi’ it is necessary that it is after *the* eating a person should drink a drink and not in the time of eating. And he says a little before that ‘Non est bibendum donec cibus de stomaco descendat’, that is, a drink should not be drunk until the food falls from the stomach. In opossitum, the common custom is against this, drinking the wine with the meal and after it. I say that it{MS page/column 4/7}
is not right *to take* the wine before the meal in the time of health. Yet it is necessary sometimes in the time of illness, that is, when there is the greatest fear of the failure of the strength the wine will not hurt — as is evident in the syncope which comes from exhaustion *weakness of strength*. And I say that in that time *in such a condition* it is right *to give it* before the meal and after it. And when it is made as an argument *given as a reason* that it should not be given upon the meal I say, according to Avicenna in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the water and the wine, that two briala drunk with the meal will not hurt the person who has made a custom of it, and so also to the healthy man after blood-letting. Nevertheless, the ordinary practice should be observed here if it is old or if it is not very bad, and it should be forsaken 


---

p.37


*given up* at that time after each other *gradually* and not suddenly. And, this it is, that I understand through this word briala the measure *so much* as is taken in one drink only, that is, as much as a person can take without change of breath, that is, without straining the breath or stopping it unwillingly. I say also that the wine is bad after every food but after *until* the food is digested and has fallen, except in caninus apititus where tender things should be given first and then wine, and that is necessary treatment. Nevertheless, it is not right to take wine after food from which evil humors are generated or before or at the time of eating, as Avicenna says in the same place, for it causes that evil humor to penetrate towards the exterior parts of the body and it is therefore that such people err as would desire to drink wine after evil *indigestible* foods *in order* to digest them, for it *the wine* goes before the digestion and it makes the body heavy.


It is therefore I say, briefly, that the wine may be given in small quantity after the meal and not in great quantity, and that it should be given to a person accustomed to it and to a person after blood-letting — and not to give it to any other person except in time of great thirst and in the other cases put *stated* in the chapter which speaks of the regulation of the water and the wine. And when he says that the wine is not right with the food I say {MS page/column 4/8}
that it is thus the words of Avicenna should be understood when he says that it is after the meal the drink should be drunk and not upon it, that is, that it is after the mouthful *bite* is swallowed and not while it is in the mouth that it should be drunk, for to drink while food is eaten causes a glut — and that is what Avicenna calls quantity. The food is more effectual *more nourishing* by that a person should not drink upon the meal anything that puts the food in motion *forces it forwards* or anything that puts it too quickly in motion, otherwise it *the food* is separated from the stomach and it is put a-swim. Nevertheless a little may be drunk after the meal so that the food may be co-mixed and stirred about


---

p.38




well, and without making *any* very great fundament and without drinking to excess after it but *rather* to increase the number of times of eating, and without increasing the ordinary quantity. And it is therefore I say that there are three *kinds of* drinks, that is, Potus alteratiuus, that is, the alterative drink, and Potus permixtinus that is the co-mixed drink, and Potus delatiuus wash-away drink. The alterative drink, it is before the food it should be taken — such as are the syrops and the heating drinks. The co-mixed drink, it is upon the meal it should be used, a little being eaten and then a little drunk, so that the proper mixing is made. The wash-away drink, furthermore, after the meal, upon the making of the digestion *after digestion*, and after the falling of the food out of the stomach, it should be taken — or in the time the food is leaving it *the stomach*. And it is therefore that Averrhoes says in the second particle of the Canticles in the ninth Comment *and* twenty, as the water which is poured into a boiling vessel stops the boiling *so* the water or the drink that is put at the end of the food which is being digested in the stomach *it* will prevent the digestion and it is therefore that not much should be drunk after the meal until the digestion is completed in the stomach. But it is effectual towards the digestion to bear thirst after of {MS page/column 5/9}
the meal. Nevertheless it is not possible to declare the quantity of the desirable *the give-able* things from proved writings as Galen says in the third Particle of his Megathegni, yet let it be done according to the judgment that is near the truth and let it be confirmed according to proofs *experience* and practice.


### THE THIRD CHAPTER — OF THE ORDER.


Of the Order of Diet or the Eating of Food. This is it, that is, when a person rises in the morning let him stretch first his hands *arms* and his chest and let him put clean clothes on and let him then expel the superfluities of the first digestion and of the second digestion and *of* the third digestion by the


---

p.39




mucus and superfluities of the nose and of the chest for these are the superfluities of the third digestion and then let him rub the body if he has proper time because of the remnants of sweat and of dust which are on the skin, for the skin is porous and it will draw towards it everything that is near it according to Galen in the first Book of Simplici Medicina. And then let him comb his head and wash his hands and his face out of cold water in the summer and out of hot water in the winter and let him wash his eyes with water *which has been* held in the mouth and warmed there, dipping his second finger in it, for that will drive away the veils of the eyes and it will cleanse them. And let him then rub his teeth with the leaf of the melon in the summer and with the skin of the yellow apple in the winter. And then let him say his Hail Mary or any other *similar* thing which he may desire. After that let him, make effort *exercise* and moderate walking in high *elevated* clean places and let his food be prepared so that he may take food the first time after that exercise what time desire begins naturally. And let him not take it *the food* before it *the desire* and let him not delay *beyond the desire* for Avicenna says in the chapter which speaks of the things eaten and drunken {MS page/column 5/10}
that the endurance of hunger beyond habit *over the usual time* causes the stomach to fill from
corrupt humors and there comes then a heavy fullness of red humors, drawn towards the mouth of the stomach so that the food cannot be eaten by natural desire *healthy appetite* though he should wish it. And a person should not eat to satiety as we have said before and only one food should be eaten at the one table *that is at one time* for Avicenna says in the above-mentioned place ‘Nichil deterius quam cibaria multiplicare et in eis temporibus prolongare’, that is, there is nothing worse than to eat too many different foods *at one time* and to prolong the time of eating, and it, is therefore that he says in the end of the chapter De regimine cibi that it sufficient for the old men to eat flesh-meat alone in the morning and bread only at


---

p.40




their supper, and let them not take immoderate *or exceptional* foods at *any* one time. Nevertheless if several *kinds of* food be eaten at one meal it is better to give the mild things first and the fat things then *afterwards* or the contrary of that; for when the mild food is eaten after the fat food it is quickly digested and the fat food is not, and it will be in that time seeking a way out and it cannot get it because the fat food is below; and it comes of that that the one is mixed with the other and they are all corrupted. Yet if one understood *rightly* how to equate the food to the stomach so much of the fat food should be given at first in proportion as the lower part of the stomach is warmer than the upper part. Yet it is not possible or not easy to do that and since you disregard what should be done incline towards the mildness *the tender things* as Avicenna says in the chapter *upon* The healing of Quartan *fever* in the second Particle of Regimenta Acutorum. Item, do not take raw food on {MS page/column 6/11}
the top of half-cooked food. And it should be therefore understood that the food abides in the body before it is entirely digested sixteen hours as Averrhoes says in the second Particle of the Canticles and the same is said in the last chapter of the sixth Book of Colliget though nine hours are said in some books, and that is a lie, for it is possible that the scrivener found a certain number written and he did not know what it was and he made a mistake in the writing *copying* and it should be sixteen hours and the reason for that *is* because Avicenna says in the chapter De regimine cibi and Averrhoes in the Canticles that it is correct feeding to eat food three times in two days, that is, twice on *some* days and once *on* the other day. And sixteen hours should be between every two times of these *that is, of taking food* so that the two natural days *in which there are eight hours and two twenties — 48 hours* shall be divided *levelly* *equally* into three portions. And the reason for that is if a mistake was made in the day on which food, was eaten twice that it may be corrected on the morrow by eating *only* once, and e contrario


---

p.41




for every evil that is done by the filling *the excess of the one day* is cured by the emptiness *of the next* and e contrario as is said in the second Particle of the Aphorisms. Yet Avicenna says in the third Book *and* in the thirteenth Section *and* in the third Tract which speaks of the delay of the descent of the food out of the stomach ‘Remanencia equalis cibi in stomacho et egressionis eius est illud quod est inter duodecim horas et uiginti duas’, that is the usual time between the remaining *from its arrival* of the food in the stomach and its leaving is between twelve hours and forty through the slowness of the working of the digestive powers. And it is therefore I say that from the time fatty food goes into the stomach that it remains there six *hours* or in the places of the other digestions, for the chyle is tenderer than the bread and therefore it is quickly changed into red blood and red blood is quickly changed to rose in the pores of the members. And Avicenna comes with this remark *namely* the food digested {MS page/column 6/12}
in all the members through sixteen hours so happening without being assimilated to them in that time. Still, from weakness of the stomach, and from the fatness and from the toughness of the food it will remain sometimes through *as long as* eighteen hours or through twenty hours as is shown in indigestion of the stomach, and when a person eats hurtful foods of some kind which remain sometimes in the pores of the stomach through a month or *even* through a quarter of a year as I have heard from truthful men that they vomited foods and medicine some times in the same quantity and substance as they were taken a month before then. Furthermore it needs be shown that milk and fish are not right on one table nor wine and milk for they predispose a person towards leprosy. And let not a very hot electuary be taken soon after food nor any one thing diuretic for they will pervert *corrupt* the food, burning it or putting it in motion too quickly. And it is therefore that the drageta made of Maratrum and of Anise and of the like is bad immediately after the meal. For it is better to rest standing or to make *take*

p.42




a gentle walk after the meal as Rufus says ‘Modicus incessus post prandium hoc est quod michi placet’, that is, it is agreeable to me an easy walk after the meal. Nevertheless to make great exertion after eating *whether* by walking or riding will corrupt the food and will prevent the digestion. *But* after that *the meal* take a moderate sleep as was said in this Canon ‘Uentres hieme et uere’ that it is well to understand the extent to which the sleep helps the digestion. Still, the sleep and the non-sleep that goes beyond moderation is wrong, as is said in the second Particle of the Aphorisms; and let it be done in the night for Hippocrates says in the first Particle of the Prognostics ‘Sompnus naturalis est qui noctem non effugit et
 {MS page/column 7/13}
diem non impedit’, that is, the natural sleep which does not avoid the night and does not prevent the day. Nevertheless many men make day of the night; sleeping in the day and awake in the night — and that is very bad. Yet, you ought to know that it is on the right side you should at first sleep for it is so that digestion is better made because the livers are *then* under the stomach, and you should afterwards turn upon the left side so that the food is not drawn towards the livers before it is fully digested, and then *again* turn upon the right side so that the thing *part* which is digested in the stomach is more easily drawn towards the livers. And this may be learned from Avicenna in the chapter which speaks of the thing eaten and drunken and in the chapter that speaks of the sleep and of the sleeplessness. And he says there also that to begin by lying on the belly will give great help towards the digestion because the natural heat is retained and because it is surrounded and it is therefore it is increased. Still, a vain *shallow* sleep is bad and to sleep quickly after food is bad for the sight. And sleep of *in* the day is bad if it is not made in nearly a sitting position and that is good after the meal and in the summer but yet in that time, only a little. And it is therefore the versifier says ‘Aut breuis aut nullus sit sompnus meridianus’, that is, let the sleep of the middle *of* day be brief otherwise don't let it be


---

p.43




done. Nevertheless if it is done before the meal let it be done of a morning till sunrise according to Hippocrates in the second Particle of the Prognostics. And it should not be done and *with* the mouth open for fear that bad air may go in and prevent the digestion. And let the head be well raised in the sleep and let him be well covered with clothes — according to Avicenna — and that is very good for *towards* the digestion. ITEM, The diseases of the mind are here considered, and it is concerning this that the versifier says ‘Sit tibi mens leta labor et moderata dieta’, that is, have a cheerful mind {MS page/column 7/14}
and moderate diet and take exercise. And greatly does bathing in sweet water suffice but that there is no food in the stomach. And let the supper be short or light unless the habit is against that; for regarding the digestion that is made during sleep it were better that not more *or not a greater quantity* were eaten at night: Yet as the sleep is made so very soon, before the food falls from the mouth of the stomach, it is therefore that too much food at night so greatly hurts the sight and it is therefore that there are many verses upon this matter *on this cause*. ‘Nocturna cena fit stomaco maxima pena’, that is, the supper of night is great pain to the stomach. ‘Si vis esse leuis sit tibi cena brevis’ — if you wish to be light let your supper be short. And there are two other verses upon the same thing. ‘Scena breuis uel cena leuis raro molesta’, that is, it is rarely that the short or light supper is injurious. ‘Magna nocet medicina docet; res est manefesta’, that is, the healing art teaches and it is a clear thing *manifest* that the large supper hurts yet more. ‘Sume cibum modice modica natura foueatur’, that is, Eat *but* a little food, for nature is satisfied with *from* a little. ‘Sic corpus refice ne mens ieiuna grauetur’ — it is so the body is known to be satisfied that the mind is not heavy *not dull* because of the abstinence *from food* [*when it remains clear without food*] and yet take the food from thee *leave it off* when the nature sooner demands it.


ITEM, let the urine and the faeces be voided *expelled*


---

p.44




and let them not for any one reason be retained beyond the time in which it is the habit to evacuate them, because they make constriction in the sides *parts* and singing in the ears from flatulence rising upwards *antiperistalsis*, or a stone *in the bladder* or hydropsy from the holding of the urine. That is for thee John from Hugh O'Cendainn.


{MS page/column 8/15}
‘Nec minctum retinere uelis nec cogere uentrem’, that is, do not desire to hold thy urine nor to force thy middle *uentrem*, that is, beyond the time in which it is right; and it is therefore that it is not well to be on the stool too long and *not well* to make forced squeezing. And it is therefore that the urine should be given *passed* six times in the day with the night for that is the *whole* natural day — and the evacuation *of the bowel* twice or thrice in the same time as these verses say. ‘In die minctura fit sexies naturali tempore bis tali uel ter sit egestio pura’.


### THIS IS THE FOURTH CHAPTER — OF THE TIME.


Regarding the time, that is, the time of the year ought to be observed for something of heed should be given to the age and the country and the time as is said in the first Particle of the Aphorisms. And yet let fat food be given in full quantity in the winter because it is said in the same place ‘Uentres hieme et uere calidissimi sunt natura’, that is, the internal cavities are very hot by nature in the winter
and in the spring, and the sleep will be very long. It is therefore that plenty food should be given and the times of eating should not be frequent for the heat is not short as in the summer but long *great* according to the extension through abundance of the spirits. Nevertheless the heat will be small in the summer taking warmth for the warm body more. *‘maior extensiue extensione raritatis sed non extensione quantitatis’*. And the food should incline towards hotness in that time, and it is apparent from that what is well said regarding the heat of the young men and youth *generally*.


In the spring however the food should be moderate but


---

p.45




inclining towards a smaller quantity because of the fullness that was done in the previous winter.


Yet, in the summer the food should be mild {MS page/column 8/16}
going into *inclining towards* coldness and that is *means* mild in quantity, that is, *only* a little should be given at one time for the substance *the sum* of the *bodily* heat will be small in that time being spent and dissipated because of the external heat. And if food mild in its substance is given it will be burned from the fiery heat. And it is therefore that Galen says in the Canon ‘Uentres hieme et cetera’ that the heat will go external in the summer to co-rejoice with the similars and it is therefore it is weakened *diminished* internally.


In the autumn, again, give the food in small quantity and it should be inclined towards warmth and moistness, and there are verses upon this ‘Quantam uis sume de mensa tempore brune’ eat the quantity you wish of food in the season of winter, ‘Tempore sed ueris cibo moderate frueris’ but use food moderately in the season of spring, ‘Et calor estatis dapibus nocet inmoderatis’ in summer evil is made *comes* of the immoderate foods. ‘Autumpni fructus extremos dant tibi luctus’ the fruits of autumn will give thee sore weeping.


### THE FIFTH CHAPTER — REGARDING THE TIMES OF EATING.


The time of eating *the proper time* is when there is true hunger as we have said in the third chapter above. And it is better in the summer *to choose* the time that is cooler, that is, before sunrise and at the time of vespers — in the evening. And the time of need *when it is really necessary* is the time in which food should be taken, and it is therefore that Galen says in libro De regemine sanitatis that no person should be compelled to observe the Rule of Health but the person who is not prevented *from following it* from any other compulsory 
 {MS page/column 9/17}
cause and who has his desire *choice* free in every one thing *a man


---

p.46




who is thoroughly well*. Yet, in the winter, let the time that is warmer be chosen and so also of the spring and of the autumn, for these *warmer times* are apportioned towards the summer and towards the winter, for it is in the portions that are nearer to the summer of them that the time should be like the time of summer and the portions which are nearer the winter let the time of moderate warmth be chosen.


### THE SIXTH CHAPTER — OF THE HABIT, OR CUSTOM.


The habit of diet should be maintained unless it is very bad *unless it disagrees or is injurious* and if it is so it ought to be departed from slowly *not too quickly* and therefore the habit which conforms with natural things should be maintained. And if it should depart *only* a little from them it should still be continued. Nevertheless if the departure *from nature* is great it should be directed back and *yet* not suddenly, as we have said. And yet let those of bad regulation *habit* take heed to themselves for though it does not show on their countenance *even if the effect is not immediately apparent* it will yet show *later on* very effectively — they shall feel it — as Avicenna says. And therefore, those who say that they can fill themselves often with food and that no hurt comes to them let them take heed to themselves for they shall be hurt; for if God took revenge upon every one sin the first time after it was committed *that is immediately* there would not be a *single* man in life, and as is all Nature, that is, God, it is so that Nature is ordered in man, that revenge *restitution* is not made the first time *or immediately* but after a season. Item, there are some people who eat more of fruits than of other foods, and they do so wrongly, for every fruit makes {MS page/column 9/18}
a watery blood unprofitable *innutritious* and it is corrupted. Nevertheless astringent fruits should be eaten after food if the middle *intestines* is relaxed — as are pears and **coctanas** and apples. But the roasted apples before a meal will relax those of red humors *of choleric temperament*, and the


---

p.47




raw apples are more astringent and every kind of them is greatly so, for the sweet apples are less astringent, and the sour apples are more so. Yet the bullaces and the raisins and the figs it is before the meal they should be taken as Isaac says In Dietis particularibus. Nevertheless the common custom is against this badly for this causes constriction from the milder things and it is therefore that they should be eaten with ginger for this fights against every corruption which comes of the fruits — according to Avicenna. But it is better to avoid fruits altogether. And it is therefore that Galen tells in the book upon the Regulation of Health that his own father was a hundred years in his life *lived a hundred years* because he did not eat fruits. Item, there are some people who prefer the tails of beasts rather than the other parts, and other people *prefer* the heads and other people the bones — and so of the other parts. It is therefore that this verse says ‘Pisces et mulieres sunt in Caudis meliores uel dulciores’ it is in their tails that the fishes and the wives are better or sweeter, but that only means that the fish is less cold in its tail than in the other parts of it because of its movement *or activity*. Nevertheless it is easier to digest the other parts as is manifest {MS page/column 10/19}
regarding the belly of salmon and its like. Nevertheless, that part which is in greater motion is the part that has less superfluity *that is less gross* and it is therefore the better part of the animals which men eat, if all other things are equal. Therefore let the more tender part be chosen which has some motion and is of better taste, for the part that tastes best nourishes best — if other things are equal. And yet the verse says ‘Non ualet in iecore quod dulce est in oire’, that is, that thing is not good in the livers which is sweet in the mouth. And it is of simple *single* sweetness that is to be understood.


Nevertheless I say of the nuts here, that there is not among all the fruits, after the figs and the raisins, a *any* fruit that is better than them, and it is therefore the verse says ‘Dic auellanas epati semper fore sanas’, that is, say that the nuts are always healthy for the livers.




---

p.48


Furthermore I say, namely, that such as would desire to indulge in co-reaching should not do so with the middle *stomach* full but after the finishing of the first digestion and the second digestion and half of the third digestion, and *I say* that it should not be indulged in *made* often, for that greatly weakens the stomach and the whole body, and it hurts the sight very greatly for it puts the eyes into great depth *it causes them to sink greatly* {MS page/column 10/20}
clearly.


Of the Blood-letting, indeed, it should be understood that it should not be over-practised, for Avicenna says in the chapter Of Blood-letting that the too frequent blood-letting causes apoplexy, and Galen says in the ninth chapter of his Megathegni ‘Minucio ceteris euacuacionibus uirtuti maiorem debilitatem infert’ the regulation *or practice* of blood-letting more greatly weakens the vitality of *than* all other practices, and the reason for that is that red blood is more akin to the nature *of man* than all other humors *fluids*. It is therefore that its practice in the time it is excessive most greatly weakens, unless the man is young and has a complexion of red blood *has a ruddy complexion* and he is resting and using of flesh meat and of other foods which nourish well for that condition demands that blood should be let more seldom *less often* for fear of Quinsy and internal ulcers — than would be the case in another person *of different temperament*. And the rule which Damascenus gives in his own Aphorisms in the second Particle *and* in the nine and fortieth Comment should be observed; that is, if a person in his youth practised to let blood four times a year it should only be let thrice *in the year* at the end of the fortieth year and once only at the end of sixty years, and after ten and three score or four score years it should not be let at all. Notwithstanding, it is the mediana *vein* that should be let at the end of sixty years and the basilica at the end of forty years for it is not right to let the cephalic *vein* {MS page/column 11/21}
beyond the end of forty years at the outside, for that will blind a person and it will pervert the memory.

p.49


The chosen time of the year, indeed, for the blood-letting, that is, the spring and the autumn. But the blood-letting of the spring is the better, for there is not one thing which preserves a person against the diseases of summer as the blood-letting of the spring does, according to Avicenna. Yet it is in two portions the time of the whole year is divided according to the people, that is, the summer and the winter. And the blood-letting should not be in a very cold time nor in a very hot *time*. And it is therefore that those err who would wish to let blood about the feast of Stephen and about the feast of John Baptist through *because of* the coldness of the one time and through the heat of the other time. But it should some times be let about Christmas to save from the illnesses which come of the filling *the excess* accustomed to be done commonly in that season.


Concerning the side on which it should be let, indeed, the versifier says ‘Estas ver dextras, autumpnus iempusque sinistras’, that is, the right hands in the spring and in the summer, and the left hands in the autumn and in the winter. And he says also as regards the Moon thus, ‘Luna uetus ueteres iuuenes noua luna requirit’, that is it should be let for *in the case of* old men when the moon is old and to the young men when it is new.


Regarding the diet after blood-letting. It should be understood that great error is then *often* made, for there are men who would like to drink and to eat a great deal in that time to make the blood again which they have lost, and it is therefore that *only* a little should be drunken and eaten. Yet more of wine should be drunk in place of *to make up for* the less food then, or as they were accustomed to,{MS page/column 11/22}
because it is easier to satisfy with drink than it is with food. Yet, avoid cheese in that time and fat flesh and salt fish and fruits and anger and exertion and be not close to a fire and do not make co-reaching and do not make but a small supper and it is therefore this verse is good ‘Prima dies uene moderacio sit tibi sene’, namely, let thy supper be moderate the first day of *after*


---

p.50




the blood-letting. Nevertheless the other verses are *lying* which would put *one* to activity and to exertion.


And if you wish to know what time begins the *proper* seasons of the year they are found in these verses ‘Uer petre detur estas et innde sequetur quam dabis urbano autumpnus simphoreano’, that is, the spring in *at* at the feast of Peter and the summer at the feast of Urban and the autumn at the feast of Simphorean. ‘Festum clementis iemis caput est orientis’, that is, the feast of Clement is the head of the beginning of winter. And this is according to the astrologers who always put the seasons to *evenness* *who divide the seasons rigidly* and not so the physicians but they call the moderate time of the year spring, and it lasts sometimes during a month, but one time it is less and another time more. The summer, indeed, it is a very hot season, and the autumn it is sometimes hot and another time cold according to different weather, and the winter is a very cold season altogether. Furthermore, namely, it should be understood that the eggs and their custard benefit such as are after blood-letting if the stomach is clean. Nevertheless, if they are got in an unclean vessel they are very easily fouled, and they are the more healthy if broken into water. Furthermore, you should know that the right time to eat this pottage is at the commencement of the meal; and it is made, in the winter, of 'kale' and of mallow and of sage and of parsley or of the white heads of leeks boiled and strained and mixed with milk of almonds. And I say that the almonds are an excellent fruit eaten whole, as they are, or with the skin taken off them, and given to the men who have had blood let and to those who are wasting and to those of phthisis. In the summer, indeed, a pottage of borage and of bugloss and of violet and of mercurial and of spinache and of patience and of lettuce and of the tops of fennel and parsley with the like — is proper, and it is well to put avens into it if the stomach is cold. The pea, however, should not be eaten except with cumin; and let not beans or peas be eaten new or old except with salt and cumin; and those


---

p.51




who have a weak stomach and flatulence let them not eat them for any reason. Nevertheless the soup of peas is good *sufficient* and it relaxes, but let there not be anything of the substance *the solid part* of the pea be *left in the soup*. Furthermore, understand that the milk greatly hurts the cold stomach and *but* it does not *hurt* the hot stomach, and for that the right thing is sour milk in the summer. The butter, indeed, let it be eaten before the foods, and let it not be eaten after a drink, and let not the top of milk, *cream* be eaten after the supper, or curds and whey for they are, constringent and tough. {MS page/column 12/24}
It should be known also that great injury is caused by the raw things such as the oysters, and the things half raw as are the birds that are badly roasted, and it is therefore that good cooking of the food and well roasting and completely *throughout* is little less than half the *work* of the internal digestion — or, to boil it well externally; and it is therefore that, those err who eat too hurriedly *or greedily* for they sometimes eat hurtful things before they are brought to their attention *before they notice it*.


### THE SEVENTH CHAPTER — OF THE AGE AND TEMPERAMENT.


The Age and the Complexion — it is almost entirely by things similar that they are regulated *nourished*. Nevertheless, the young men will digest more of fat things and of hard things than the old men because of their agedness and the sons *or youth generally* the moist things, that is, the tender or soft things, for the diet should be renewing *restorative* and *only* a little should be eaten *but that* frequently. And those given to study should be nourished like old people, for the studying dries them; so let them eat tender things according to their sufferance *as they can bear them* so that their blood is replenished quickly and well. Those who labour, however, let them eat roasted fat things for these are the things that resist *the waste* of labour. For though the roasted things are moister


---

p.52




within than the things cooked upon water from the moistness of the substance inside, yet they are dry outside and they are altogether more solid, and it is therefore that they are difficult to separate from their heat and therefore they are the more difficult to digest. The things that are cooked {MS page/column 13/25}
in bread they are moist and *but* they are good. Nevertheless the pastil bread is bad. And it is a very broad *comprehensive* rule that the food which adheres to the fingers when it is being touched should be avoided, for it is tough. And the roast things kept over night are not good *even* with a covering upon them, nor the very tender things at the end of the meal. The moderate abstinence is a very high treatment; and it is therefore that Galen said ‘Commedo ut uiuam non uiua ut commedam’, that is, it is to be in life that I eat and not for eating that I am in life. Yet, it is said in the first Particle of the Aphorisms ‘Senes facilime ferunt ieiunium, that is, the old men more easily bear emptiness’, and these are the old men from their agedness, and then the young men, and then the youths, and then the old men from their age. And so also those of cold humors fully enjoy to suffer emptiness *hunger* and those of middling red blood *well-blooded people* but those of red humors or of black humors cannot suffer it. And yet those of black humors bear it better than those of red humors for the heat is less which they set free within them, and they spend more upon the thing *or work* upon which they employ themselves *they have less resistance*. And the versifier has put *made* verses upon the regulation of health ‘Si vis incolumem si uis te redere sanum curas tolle graues irasci credere profanum’, that is, if you desire to be whole put heavy sorrow from thee and believe that it is vain *foolish* of thee to make anger. {MS page/column 13/26}
‘Parce mero scenare caue nec sit tibi uanum pergere post epulas sompum fuge meridianum’, that is, spare wine and avoid supper, and do not think it foolish to have a walk after the meal, and avoid the sleep of the middle-day. ‘Non teneas minctum nec cogas fortiter anum’, that is, do not retain thy urine and do not constrain too strongly thy seat. And there are other verses


---

p.53




upon the wine ‘Dat uinum purum tibi ter tria comoda primum’ 
, that is, there are nine *thrice three* eases *or comforts* which the clean wine gives thee ‘Uires multiplicat et uiscera plena relaxata’ that is it multiplies *increases* the strength and it relaxes the full intestines. ‘Confortat stomacum ceribrum cor dat tibi letum’, that is, it strengthens the stomach and the brain, and it will give thee the light heart, and it will make *give* boldness *courage*, and it will call forth the perspiration, and it will sharpen the intellect, and it will give assistance to the friends *it will promote friendship*. Yet let moderation be along with it so that its working *efficacy* may not be perverted, for all these *good effects* will be undone without the moderation. And because the wine is sometimes drunk finally, remember this verse ‘Potus tarde datus multos facit cruciatus, that is, the drink that is drunk finally will give thee many pains’. Item, let cinnamon be used frequently for it will bring the mouth to sweetness and it will suffice against the cold rheum, and it will prevent the corruption of the humors in them; and it is therefore it is said ‘Non moriet homo commedens sepe 
 {MS page/column 14/27}
de cinamomo’, that is, the person who eats cinnamon frequently will not go to his death from corruption of the humors for that is prevented if the nourishment *regulation* is well in other respects from that outwards. And it should be understood that the water must be clean, and the air is cleaned scientifically *quickly* by means of a good fire, if it is not found naturally clean. And this is sufficient though a great deal more might be said here.


IT ENDS.
Make a note that it is in six positions the horn should be put in bleeding *cupping*. The first position — in the furrow at the back of the head, and it will empty *draw from* the animal parts there, and it will relieve headache especially, and diseases of the eyes, and the filth of the night *upon the eyes* shall be cleansed, and it will serve or deplete the region of the vein called


---

p.54




Cephalic. The second position, namely, between the two shoulder-blades, and it will there draw from the spiritual parts, and it will comfort dyspnoea and the asthma and the ortomia and it does *controls* the area of the vein called Mediana. The third position, namely, on the roots of the forearm and it will draw from the hands and it will relieve the seregra that is in them. The fourth position between the kidneys and the buttock, and it will there draw from the organs of nutrition *the nutritive parts* and it influences the province of the vein called Basilic. The fifth position — on the flat of the hip, against the lipra and eruption of the hip and eruption of the whole body, and against urine disease, such as **stranguria**, and against every disease in the parts leading thereto. The sixth position, namely, upon the flat of the calf, and that will draw from {MS page/column 14/28}
the feet, and it does the area of the vein called Saphenous, and it will call forth the monthly blood.


 that is Ounce; that is Dragma; that is Scruple.


PERITISIMUS OMNIUM RERUM Hippocrates et cetira, that is, the key of all knowledge *is* Hippocrates, and he commanded that the knowledge and the prognostics of the death and the life of all *human* bodies should be written *at the end of his life* and that this should be placed along with himself in the coffin, and he ordered that it should be put under his head in the burial, for fear the other philosophers might get his Arcanum and the secret of his heart.


At the end of much time after that, the Emperor came, that is, Caesar; and he ordered the tomb to be opened — seeking treasure, that is, gold or gems or precious jewels. And the thing he found there was a shapen box which being lifted and opened what was found in it was a document on which was the Arcanum of Hippocrates. And the Emperor ordered it to be given to the physician of his own body and flesh and Amustosio was the name of the physician. He saw the people, and he read


---

p.55




the document, and having understood it he pointed out to the Emperor that it was the Arcanum of Hippocrates and the prognostics of death and of life to the human body. And Hippocrates spoke first of all regarding the signs of death pertaining to the Head, and he said if there is pain in the head and swelling of the nostrils that signifies death upon the fourteen and twentieth day *34th*. Item, the person on whom there is Frenzy,{MS page/column 15/29}
if his cheek is red *flushed* with his face puffed with defect of digestion in the stomach ...


**Stranguria** is *to be* interpreted *as* the emission of the urine in drops *and* that is not a trifling *small* matter. Donald MacBeath wrote this.


The first post-script beginning in Col. 27 would seem to be a personal MacBeath note based upon practical experience and observation — for I have not been able to trace its origin otherwise. It would seem also to be in the same handwriting as the text, so far.


The second post-script introduced by Peritisimus omnium rerum Ipocras is in a new hand without doubt, and most probably that of one of the MacBeaths themselves. At the middle of the fourteenth line down, another and coarser hand takes the same incompleted matter up. This is almost certainly that of James MacBeath, whom we find making other additions to the manuscript in the year 1598 — and long after the O'Cendains and the O'Kearneys had finished their work — when


---

p.56




the book as it stands was in the family possession. From this we must learn that the Capsula Eburnea, presently to be referred to, was also, and continuously, in the hands of the MacBeaths.


In a collection of classic, medical, Latin tracts called Articella, which was, I think, first published at Venice about the middle of the fifteenth century, the piece Capsula Eburnea appears along with tracts from the works of Phylaretus, others of Hippocrates, Johannus Damascenus, Galen, Celsus, Avicenna *the Cantics*, and others. It is headed ‘Liber Hippocratis dictus Capsula Eburnea qui in ejus sepulchro inuentus fertur’. My edition was printed in London in the year 1519.


The Tract is introduced as follows — Peruenit ad nos quod cum Hyppocrates morti appropinquaret percepit ut uirtutes iste scripte ponerentur in capsa eburnea et poneretur capsa cum eo in sepulchro suo ne aliquis eam detegeret. Cum ergo uoluit Cesar uidere sepulchrum Hyppo*cratis* peruenit ad ipsum: aspexit ipsum: erat aut valde percepit ipsum renouari et fabricari et corpus ejus si integrum inueniret deferri sibi quidquam foderet sepulchrum inuenta est in eo hec capsa eburnea: et in ea iste uirtutes: delata est ergo Cesari: qui in ea aspiciens: Misdos amico suo fideli traditit’’

 — from which, when compared with the Gaelic rendering, it may be seen that the parallel is not very even between the two.


It would seem that the MacBeaths attached some importance to this tract; and it is surely very interesting, if its history is true, even if it is of no meaning to us in this time. There was a desire to continue it, but James was certainly not the man to do it. It has, however, been done. It was used as base for a Chapter in another Gaelic MS. which lies at the Museum (Egerton, 159), and as it must be of interest for purposes of comparison, I give here a part of it which more than covers the post-script.

The tract is translated in full (Eg. 159), but it does not follow the Latin very closely, especially in the matter of 'critical days'. The forms of the language are distinctly nearer to those of our own time, and the writing is in many respects like that of Adv. III. Both are almost certainly of the late sixteenth or the early seventeenth century.


Since I finished my work on this text, I have examined MS. Adv. LX, and I find that my note, p. 3, — 1511, must be corrected. The MS. was. written at Dunolly, Argyll, in the end

of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth — and the signatures, which are frequent, leave no room to doubt that Maconochie or Duncan's Son cannot be equated with the Connacher who wrote this book. The signatures are always i *qbair, i conqbhair, and y *qbair — and this is one of the oldest and most famous names in the whole tradition and history of Ireland, easily contemporary with the Christian era. It is Connor now, but Connacher is much nearer to the original. The adherence to the Irish generic i and y for Irish ui and modern O' is very interesting and suggestive; and one wonders whether these men of Con-acht may not after all be the Kun-etae of Herodotus.

### NOTES

### COLUMN 1


I here give the whole of the First Chapter from the Latin text of 1501 for purposes of comparison with the Gaelic.


Regimen Sanitatis est triplex, Conseruatiuum, Preseruatiuum et Reductiuum ut innuit **Hali** tertia particula Tegni can. 19. Conseruatiuum competit sanis, Preseruatiuum neutris, Reductiuum egris. Sed Preseruatiuum nominatur Conseruatiuum ut dicit **Haly** tertia particula Tegni (téchnés) commento 55. Dico ergo quod Conseruatio fit per similia — unde tertia particula Tegni Si vis conservare crasim qualem concepisti similia similibus offeras. Corpori ergo temporato debent dari omnia similia in gradu et forma. Sed corpori lapso lapsu naturali debent dari similia in forma sed non in gradu propter inclinationem quam habent ad lapsum ut dicit Auicen. 6.o Colliget ultra medium lib. cap. de regimine complexionum malarum. Si dicas similia non patiuntur a similibus sibi dicit Auicen. libro p*ri*mo, fen 2.a capitu de signis complexionis Dico quod membra agunt a tota specie in cibum et ideo dico quod digestio fit a toto specie membri per calidum tanquam per instrumentum sicut dicit **Auer.** 5.o Colliget de stomacho structionis quod in minori tempore dissolvitur ferrum quam in igne a toto specie. Sic dico in proposito vel dico quod a similia non fit passio in rebus inanimatis sed in rebus animatis bene potest fieri. Corpora ergo lapsa regantur cum similibus in forma quando ipsa sunt in temperamento eis debito sed non in gradu quia gradus debet esse remissior in cibo quam in corpore nutriendo. Et debit talis regi per cibum medicinalem quia per cibum absolute complexio temperata absolute regi debet dicit **Haly** tertia particula Tegni in commento illius Calidiora calidioribus indigent adjutoriis quod lapsum corpus vel calidum ab equalitate per duos gradus debet regi cum calidis in primo gradu vocat frigidum, quia calidum remisse frigidum est in ore medici. Et ideo aliqui errando dicunt ex **Haly** quod calida debent conservari

cum frigidis; hoc est falsum. Tamen preservari possunt cum frigidis remissis et in gradu remissioribus quam sit corpus preservandum. Sed reductio debet esse perfecte in opposito latere in eodem gradu. Hic tamen sciendum quod calida debent regi per remisse calida et frigida per remisse frigida et sicca per remisse sicca, etcetera. Sicut melancolica cum remisse frigidis et siccis remisse et hoc est cum calidis et humidis non absolute sed respectu complexionis melancolice. Sicut Commentator Dama. particula quinta asso. commento 67 quod vinum est calidum et siccum tamen respectu melancolie est calidum et humidum. Sic dico in proposito quod ita complexio flegmatica debet regi per frigida remisse et humida et hoc est per calida et sicca remisse. Si tamen complexio flegmatica sit lapsa lapsu accidentali ad frigitatem et humiditatem tunc debet regi per calida et sicca intensa et hoc est reducere. Consideranda tamen sunt in regimine sanitatis, qualitas, quantitas, ordo, tempus anni, hora prandendi, consuetudo, et etas. De qualitate cibi iam dictum est quia debet esse similis vel in gradu et forma vel in forma licet non in gradu quia ut dixi prius remisse calidum vocatur frigidum a medico et simile est frigidum frigido. Et cum hoc vinum omne calidum et ideo non est intelligendum quod frigida sint similia corpori humano nisi frigida in remisso gradu, quae sunt calida in ore medici.
