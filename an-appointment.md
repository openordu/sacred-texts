p.76


1. Being out of heart with government
  
I took a broken root to fling
  
Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,
  
Taking delight that he could spring;
  
And he, with that low whinnying sound
  
That is like laughter, sprang again
  
And so to the other tree at a bound.
  
Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,
  
Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
  
And threw him up to laugh on the bough;
  
No government appointed him.
