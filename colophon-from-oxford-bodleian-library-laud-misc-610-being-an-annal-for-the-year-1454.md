This is the age of the Lord this present Christmas viz. 1454 years. And we could relate much of the excellence of the owner of this book, but that he himself would not let us set it down. However, I cannot but tell of the hosting which he made in Hy Feilme Perhaps hÚi Feilmeadha in the barony of Ballaghkeen, Co. Wexford.

, for we were on it for eight days and eight nights in spite of the men of Leinster; and the reason why I mention it above every victory and every hosting, and all that he took of castles, is that I myself was by his side in this hosting, and for the abundance of wine and meat and usequebaugh  i.e. whiskey

, and all manner of good things I got there, and I in the bed of my lord.
