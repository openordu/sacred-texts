p.275


Eochaid Bélbuide, son of Feidlimid Rechtmar, was Conn's brother. He went into Ulster under safeguard, to escape from his brother Conn, for Eochaid was ill-bred and unruly, and was destroying his brother's rule and authority. Then, however, Conn sent five of his confidential servants to the kings of Ulster, so that Eochaid Bélbuide might not stay with them, or so that they might be[1](javascript:footNote('T301043/note001.html')) well-behaved. These were the five envoys who went for that purpose: Foitin Forbair son of Féige Échtach, Énda son of Daig Laigen, Ailill son of Fingein mac Luchta, Tibraide Tuaithebrach son of Cleitech, and Asal son of Forannán from Formael. They went on northwards from Tara. Then they were told that Eochaid Bélbuide was hunting on Sliab Breg, and they slew Eochaid there, for none was found with him save his hound ut poeta dixit—


> 1. Eochaid Bélbuide was slain
>   
> in the battle of Comar, hence the fury caused by it,
>   
> as there was no one in his place,
>   
> he and his hound were taken unprotected.
> 




This deed was displeasing to the kings of Ulster, and they said that for the outrage done to them they would accept no terms (from Conn) but his death, for that before their time such only had been accepted. Howbeit peace was made between them and Conn. The kings of Ulster at that time were Cairbre Gnáthchorad son of Mál son of Rochraide, and Bresal son of Brión. Thereafter some of them died. Bresal, or Tibraide, son of Mál said that he would not accept peace, because he durst not stay henceforth in Ulster for fear of Conn and for fear of the kings of Ulster through Conn's oppression of them.

p.277


What Tibraide did was to go to Scotland, to the king of Scotland, Failbe Findloga, and he was three years with him. Then the king of Scotland advised him to come to Ireland and make peace with Conn. It was all done thus. The Ulstermen bid him be at peace with Conn. He said [*gap: text omitted*] to make *peace?*, but he did not venture to come to Conn under safeguard or by himself, so he determined to come to Conn, (himself and his men) disguised as veiled women. At that time Conn was on an eminence[2](javascript:footNote('T301043/note002.html')) preparing the Feast of Tara and . . . the district of Tara, and Conn was alone at that time. Then Tibraide slew Conn, for he was alone and Tibraide had many followers. So that is how Conn was slain.


Finit. Amen.
