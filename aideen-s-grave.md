p.6


### Introductory Note


[Aideen, daughter of Angus of Ben-Edar (now the Hill of Howth), died of grief for the loss of her husband, Oscar, son of Ossian, who was slain at the battle of Gavra (Gowra, near Tara in Meath), A.D. 284. Oscar was entombed in the rath or earthen fortress that occupied part of the field of battle, the rest of the slain being cast in a pit outside. Aideen is said to have buried on Howth, near the mansion of her father, and poetical tradition represents the Fenian heroes as present at her obsequies. The Cromlech in Howth Park has been supposed to be her sepulchre. It stands under the summits from which the poet Atharne is said to have launched his invectives against the people of Leinster, until, by the blighting effect of his satires, they were compelled to make him atonement for the death of his son.]


1. They heaved the stone; they heap'd the cairn:
  
Said Ossian "In a queenly grave
  
We leave her, 'mong her fields of fern
  
Between the cliff and wave.
2. "The cliff behind stands clear and bare,
  
And bare, above, the heathery steep
  
Scales the clear heaven's expanse, to where
  
The Danaan Druids sleep.
3. "And all the sands that, left and right,
  
The grassy isthmus-ridge confine,
  
in yellow bars le bared and bright
  
Among the sparkling brine.

p.7

6. "A clear pure air pervades the scene,
  
In loneliness and awe secure;
  
Meet spot to sepulchre a Queen
  
Who in her life was pure.
7. "Here, far from camp and chase removed,
  
Apart in Nature's quiet room,
  
The music that alive she loved
  
Shall cheer her in the tomb.
8. "The humming of the noontide bees,
  
The lark's loud carol all day long,
  
And, borne on evening's salted breeze,
  
The clanking sea bird's song
9. "Shall round her airy chamber float,
  
And with the whispering winds and steams
  
Attune to Nature's tenderest note
  
The tenor of her dreams.
10. "And oft, at tranquil eve's decline
  
When full tides lip the Old Green Plain,
  
The lowing of Moynalty's kine
  
Shall round her breathe again,
11. "In sweet remembrance of the days
  
When, duteous, in the lowly vale
  
Unconscious of my Oscar's gale,
  
She fill'd the fragrant pail,
12. "And, duteous, from the running brook
  
Drew water for the bath; nor deem'd
  
A king did on her labour look,
  
And she a fairy seem'd.

p.8

15. "But when the wintry frosts begin,
  
And in their long-drawn, lofty flight,
  
The wild geese with their airy din
  
Distend the ear of night,
16. "And whne the fierce De Danaan ghosts
  
At midnight from their peak come down,
  
When all around the enchanted coasts
  
Despairing strangers drown;
17. "When, mingling with the wreckful wail,
  
From low Clontarf's wave-trampled floor
  
Comes booming up the burthen'd gale
  
The angry Sand-Bull's roar;
18. "Or, angrier than the sea, the shout
  
Of Erin's hosts in wrath combined,
  
When Terror heads Oppression's rout,
  
And Freedom cheers behind: —
19. "Then o'er our lady's placid dream,
  
Where safe from storms she sleeps, may steal
  
Such jo as will not misbeseem
  
A Queen of men to feel:
20. "Such thrill of free, defiant pride,
  
As rapt her in her battle car
  
At Gavra, when by Oscar's side
  
She rode the ridge of war,
21. "Exulting, down the shouting troops,
  
And through the thick confronting kings,
  
With hands on all their javelin loops
  
And shafts on all their strings;

p.9

24. "E'er closed the inseparable crowds,
  
No more to part for me, and show,
  
As bursts the sun through scattering clouds,
  
My Oscar issuing so.
25. "No more, dispelling battle's gloom
  
Shall son for me from fight return;
  
The great green rath's ten-acred tomb
  
Lies heavy on his urn.
26. "A cup of bodkin-pencill'd clay
  
Holds Oscar; mighty heart and limb
  
One handful now of ashes grey:
  
And she has died for him.
27. "And here, hard by her natal bower
  
On lone Ben Edar's side, we strive
  
With lifted rock and sign of power
  
To keep her name alive.
28. "That while, from circling year to year,
  
Her Ogham-letter'd stone is seen,
  
The Gael shall say, 'Our Fenians here
  
Entomb's their loved Aideen.'
29. "The Ogham from her pillar stone
  
In tract of time will wear away;
  
Her name at last be only know
  
In Ossian's echo'd lay.
30. "The long forgotten lay I sing
  
May only ages hence revive,
  
(As eagle with a wounded wing
  
To soar again might strive,)


---

p.10

33. "Imperfect, in an alien speech,
  
When, wandering here, some child of chance
  
Through pangs of keen delight shall reach
  
The gift of utterance, —
34. "To speak the air, the sky to speak,
  
The freshness of the hill to tell,
  
Who, roaming bare Ben Edar's peak
  
And Aideen's briary dell,
35. "And gazing on the Cromlech vast,
  
And on the mountain and the sea,
  
Shall catch communion with the past
  
And mix himself with me.
36. "Child of the Future's doubtful night,
  
Wate'er your speech, whoe'r your sires,
  
Sing while you may with frank delight
  
The song your house inspires.
37. "Sing while you may, nor grieve to know
  
The song you sing shall also die;
  
Atharna's lay has perish'd so,
  
Though once it thrill'd this sky.
38. "Above us, from his rocky chair,
  
There, where Ben Edar's landward crest
  
O'er eastern Bregia bends, to where
  
Dun Almon crowns the west:
39. "And all that felt the fretted air
  
Throughout the song-distemper'd clime,
  
Did droop, till suppliant Leinster's prayer
  
Appeased the vengeful rhyme.

p.11

42. "Ah me, or e'er the hour arrive
  
Shall bid my long-forgotten tones,
  
Unknown One, on your lips revive,
  
Here, by these moss-grown stones,
43. "What change shall o'er the scene have cross'd;
  
What conquering lords anew have come;
  
What lore-arm'd, mightier Druid host
  
From Gaul or distant Rome!
44. "What arts of death, what ways of life,
  
What creeds unknown to bard or seer,
  
Shall round your careless steps be rife,
  
Who pause and ponder here;
45. "And, haply, where yon curlew calls
  
Athwart the marsh, 'mid groves and bowers
  
See rise some mighty chieftain's halls
  
With unimagined towers:
46. "And baying hounds, and coursers bright,
  
And burnish'd cars of dazzling sheen,
  
With courtly train of dame and knight,
  
Where now the fern is green.
47. "Or, by yon prostrate altar-stone
  
May kneel, perchance, and, free from blame,
  
Hear holy men with rites unknown
  
New names of God proclaim.
48. "Let change as may the Name of Awe,
  
Let rite surcease and altar fall,
  
The same One God remains, a law
  
For ever and for all.

p.12

51. "Let change as may the face of earth,
  
Let alter all the social frame,
  
For mortal men the ways of birth
  
And death are still the same.
52. "And still, as life and time wear on,
  
The children of the waning days,
  
(Though strength be from their shoulders gone
  
To lift the loads we raise,)
53. "Shall weep to do the burial rites
  
Of lost ones loved; and fondly found,
  
In shadow of the gathering nights,
  
The monumental mound.
54. "Farewell! The strength of men is worn;
  
The night approaches dark and chill:
  
Sleep, till perchance an endless morn
  
Descend the glittering hill."
55. Of Oscar and Aideen bereft,
  
So Ossian sang. The Fenians sped
  
Three mighty shouts to heaven; and left
  
Ben Edar to the dead.
