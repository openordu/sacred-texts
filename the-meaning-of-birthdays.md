1. He who is born on Sunday will be longlived, his life will be happy, he will have wealth in the world, he will be in favour with kings and **erenaghs**, great will be his power, his profit in his own hands.
2. He who is born on Monday, his wealth in cattle will be good, there will be a blemish on his face, he will not be sharp, he will be generous, many **culdees** will sing his requiem, and repentance will come to him before death.
3. He who is born on Tuesday, drowning will carry him off, great will be his wealth in small cattle, his power will not be strong, he will be a favourite with women and dogs.
4. He who is born on Wednesday, a blemish on his body, he will die a bloody death, his speech will be venomous, he will be hated, he will be a powerful plunderer, he will do a dire deed before death.

9. He who is born on Saturday, fever (?) and a bowel-disease will carry him off, great will be his dignity, he will do evil deeds, he will be venomous, he will be a parricide, he will do many slaughters, he will lead a licentious life.
