### The Treaty of Limerick, 1691: Author: Baron Godert de Ginkel




---

p.298


Articles agreed upon the third day of October; one thousand six hundred and ninety-one, between the right honourable **sir Charles Porter, knight**, and **Thomas Coningsby, esq.**, lords justices of **Ireland**, and his excellency the **baron de Ginkel, lieutenant-general, and commander in chief of the English army**, on the one part, and the right honourable **Patrick earl of **Lucan****, **Piercy viscount Galmoy**, **colonel Nicholas Purcel**, **colonel Nicholas Cusack**, **sir Toby Butler**, **colonel Garret Dillon**, and **colonel John Brown**, on the other part, in the behalf of the Irish inhabitants in the city and county of **Limerick**, the counties of **Clare**, **Kerry**, **Cork**, **Sligo**, and **Mayo**:


In consideration of the surrender of the city of **Limerick**, and other agreements made between the said **lieutenant-general Ginkel**, the governor of the city of **Limerick**, and the generals of the Irish army, bearing date with these presents, for the surrender of the said city and submission of the said army, it is agreed, that



1. The Roman Catholics of this kingdom shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion as are consistent with the laws of **Ireland**, or as they did enjoy in the reign of **king Charles the second**: and their majesties, as soon as their affairs will permit them to summon a parliament in this kingdom, will endeavour to procure the said Roman Catholics such farther security in that particular, as may preserve them from any disturbance upon the account of their said religion.
2. All the inhabitants or residents of **Limerick**, or any other garrison now in the possession of the Irish, and all officers and soldiers now in arms, under any commission of **king James**, or those authorized by him to grant the same, in the several counties of **Limerick**, **Clare**, **Kerry**, **Cork**, and **Mayo**, or any of them; and all the commissioned officers in their majesties' quarters that belong to the Irish regiments now in being,

that are treated with, and who are not prisoners of war, or have taken protection and who shall return and submit to their majesties' obedience, and their and every of their heirs, shall hold, possess, and enjoy all and every their estates of freehold and inheritance, and all the rights, titles and interests, privileges and immunities, which they and every or any of them held, enjoyed, or were rightfully and lawfully entitled to in the reign of **king Charles II.**, or at any time since, by the laws and statutes that were in force in the said reign of **king Charles II.**, and shall be put in possession, by order of the government, of such of them as are in the king's hands, or the hands of his tenants, without being put to any suit or trouble therein; and all such estates shall be freed and discharged from all arrears of crown-rents, quit-rents, and other public charges incurred and become due since Michaelmas, 1688, to the day of the date hereof: and all persons comprehended in this article shall have, hold, and enjoy all their goods and chattels, real and personal, to them or any of them belonging and remaining, either in their own hands or the hands of any persons whatsoever, in trust for or for the use of them or any of them: and all and every the said persons, of what profession, trade or calling soever they be, shall and may use, exercise, and practise their several and respective professions, trades, and callings as freely as they did use, exercise, and enjoy the same in the reign of **king Charles II.**, provided that nothing in this article contained be construed to extend to or restore any forfeiting person now out of the kingdom, except what are hereafter comprized: provided also, that no person whatsoever shall have or enjoy the benefit of this article, that shall neglect or refuse to take the oath of allegiance, made by act of parliament in **England**, in the first year of the reign of their present majesties, when thereunto required.
3. All merchants or reputed merchants of the city of **Limerick**, or of any other garrison now possessed by the Irish, or of any town or place in the counties of **Clare** or **Kerry**, who are absent beyond the seas, that not bore arms since their majesties' declaration in February, 1688, shall have the benefit of the second article in the same manner as if they were present, provided such merchants and reputed merchants do repair

into this kingdom within the space of eight months from the date hereof.
4. The following officers, viz., **colonel Simon Lutterel**, **captain Rowland White**, **Maurice Eustace**, of **Yeomanstown**, Chievers of **Maystown**, commonly called **Mount Leinster**, now belonging to the regiments in the aforesaid garrisons and quarters of the Irish army, who were beyond the seas, and sent thither upon affairs of their respective regiments or the army in general, shall have the benefit and advantage of the second article, provided they return hither within the space of eight months from the date of these presents, and submit to their majesties' government and take the above-mentioned oath.
5. That all and singular the said persons comprized in the second and third articles, shall have a general pardon of all attainders, outlawries, treasons, misprisions of treason, premunires, felonies, trespasses, and other crimes and misdemeanours whatsoever by them or any of them committed since the beginning of the reign of **king James II.**; and if any of them are attainted by parliament, the lords justices and general will use their best endeavours to get the same repealed by parliament and the outlawries to be reversed gratis, all but writing clerks' fees.
6. And whereas these present wars have drawn on great violences on both parts, and that if leave were given to the bringing all sorts of private actions, the animosities would probably continue that have been too long on foot, and the public disturbances last; for the quieting and settling, therefore, of this kingdom, and avoiding those inconveniences which would be the necessary consequence of the contrary, no person or persons whatsoever comprized in the foregoing articles shall be sued, molested, or impleaded at the suit of any party or parties whatsoever, for any trespasses by them committed, or for any arms, horses, money, goods, chattels, merchandizes, or provisions whatsoever by them seized or taken during the time of the war. And no person or persons whatsoever in the second or third articles comprized shall be sued, impleaded, or made accountable for the rents or mean rates of any lands, tenements, or houses by him or them received or enjoyed in this kingdom, since the beginning of the present war to the day of the date

hereof, nor for any waste or trespass by him or them committed in any such lands, tenements, or houses; and it is also agreed that this article shall be mutual and reciprocal on both sides.
7. Every nobleman and gentleman comprized in the said second and third article, shall have liberty to ride with a sword and case of pistols, if they think fit, and keep a gun in their houses for the defence of the same, or for fowling.
8. The inhabitants and residents in the city of **Limerick**, and other garrisons, shall be permitted to remove their goods, chattels, and provisions out of the same, without being viewed and searched, or paying any manner of duties, and shall not be compelled to leave the houses or lodgings they now have for the space of six weeks next ensuing the date hereof.
9. The oath to be administered to such Roman Catholics as submit to their majesties' government, shall be the oath abovesaid and no other.
10. No person or persons who shall at any time hereafter break these articles, or any of them, shall thereby make, or cause any other person or persons to forfeit or lose the benefit of the same.
11. The lords justices and general do promise to use their utmost endeavours, that all the persons comprehended in the above-mentioned articles shall be protected and defended from all arrests and executions for debt or damage, for the space of eight months next ensuing the date hereof.
12. Lastly, the lords justices and general do undertake that their majesties will ratify these articles within the space of eight months, or sooner, and use their utmost endeavours that the same shall be ratified and confirmed in parliament.
13. And whereas **colonel John Brown** stood indebted to several Protestants by judgments of record, which appearing to the late government, the lord Tyrconnell and **lord Lucan** took away the effects the said **John Brown** had to answer the said debts, and promised to clear the said **John Brown** of the said debts, which effects were taken for the public use of the Irish and their army: for freeing the said **lord Lucan** of his said engagement, past on their public account, for payment

of the said Protestants, and for preventing the ruin of the said **John Brown**, and for satisfaction of his creditors, at the instance of the **lord Lucan** and the rest of the persons aforesaid, it is agreed that the said lords justices and the said baron de Ginkel, shall intercede with the king and parliament to have the estates secured to Roman Catholics by articles and capitulation in this kingdom charged with and equally liable to the payment of so much of the said debts as the said **lord Lucan**, upon stating accounts with the said **John Brown**, shall certify under his hand that the effects taken from the said **John Brown** amount unto; which account is to be stated, and the balance certified by the said **lord Lucan** in one and twenty days after the date hereof. For the true performance hereof we have hereunto set our hands: —**Charles Porter**, **Thomas Coningsby**, **Baron de Ginkel**. —Present: *Scravemoer*, H. Mackay, T. Talmach.



Military articles agreed upon between the baron de Ginkel, lieutenant-general and commander-in-chief of the English army, on the one side, and the lieutenant-generals D'Usson and De Tessé, commanders-in-chief of the Irish army, on the other; and the general officers hereunto subscribing:



1. That all persons, without any exceptions, of what quality or condition soever, that are willing to leave the kingdom of **Ireland**, shall have free liberty to go to any country beyond the seas (**England** and **Scotland** excepted) where they think fit, with their families, household-stuff, plate, and jewels.
