### Encoding


#### Project Description


CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts.


#### Sampling Declaration


Text represents odd pages 3-519. Corrigenda are integrated.


#### Editorial Declaration


##### Correction


Text has been proof-read three times and parsed using NSGMLS.


##### Normalization


The electronic text represents the edited text. The few misprints and inconsistent renderings of Irish names are tagged corr sic. Unrecognizable spellings of English names are tagged orig reg with the regularisation contained in the reg attribute. Explanatory text supplied by the editor, and placed in brackets, in parentheses and/or italics in the hardcopy, is tagged sup resp="WMH". Only footnotes relating to the manuscripts and their deficiencies are retained. They are tagged note type="auth" n="", and numbered.


##### Quotation


Quotation marks for direct speech are rendered q.


##### Hyphenation


Soft hyphens are silently removed. When a hyphenated word (hard or soft) 

crosses a page-break or line-break, the break is marked after the completion 

of hyphenated word and punctuation mark.


##### Segmentation


div0=the body of annals; div1

represents the individual annal (i.e. the entries for one year); 

div2 represents the individual entry in a given annal. Passages 

of verse occurring within paragraphs are treated as embedded texts; stanzas 

are marked lg, and metrical lines are marked l. 

Page-breaks are marked.


##### Interpretation


Names of persons, groups and places are not tagged. Neither are terms for

cultural and social roles. Latin words and passages are tagged frn

lang="la"; Irish terms are tagged term lang="ga".


#### Canonical References


This text uses the DIV1 element to represent the Annal. ### Profile Description

And as no evil goes unrevenged, nor offence unpunished, these transactions did not pass without being promptly avenged by the Cenel-Conaill. And thus it was that these things happened to them, viz.:—the son of O'Neill was left with a small company at the close of the day, and Henry O'Gairmledhaigh's prey before him; and these preys were taken from him by the Cenel-Moan. And this was the joy with sorrow to the Cenel-Moan, for he *Brian* killed the son of O'Gairmledhaigh with one stroke of his sword. And immediately afterwards the Cenel-Conaill all closed around the powerful hero, and the great feat was performed by Toirdhelbach O'Domhnaill. And Niall, son of Niall Garbh O'Domhnaill, and Maelsechlainn, son of Flaithbhertach O'Ruairc, were slain in the beginning of that day by the Eoghanachs; and their losses besides were very great; but the enumeration of all cannot be attempted for fear of prolixity.

and by Donnchadh Mac Domhnaill, Mac Diarmada's constable, and by Lochlainn Colach Mac Caba, and the recruits of Magh-Luirg, in the beginning of the day, on this mixed and hostile army; and a great multitude of inferior persons were slain by Mac Diarmada's people. Nevertheless, this was at last the "joy with sorrow" to Mac Diarmada's people, for some one of the combatants directed a terrible return shot of an arrow at the immense phalanx of chiefs of the great host who were protecting the high prince, and guarding him from the dangers of the conflict; and the worthless rabble and inferior people, and the champions of valour and warriors of the host besides, were avoided by this arrow, and the point of the black, devilish dart entered plainly in the prince's throat. In fine, immediately after this irreparable reverse, and irresistible mishap, experienced by the nobles of Sliabh-Seghsa, and the heroes of Cnoc-in-scail, and of Tulchan-Maelruanaidh-Moir (of which all in general now say, ut dixit the poet, i.e. Mac Coise,

Both these armies went to the upper part of Geshill; and the Abbot's son went with his own band to Cluain-imorruis, to the town of Gilla Buidhe Mac Maelcorra, (and by my word it were better for them that they had not gone), where the Calbhach, son of Murchadh O'Conchobhair, and Cathal O'Conchobhair, with six horsemen, overtook them. And the Gilla Buidhe said, (the Calbhach's cauldron, which he had as a loan whilst brewing ale, being of the back of a young man of the army), ‘there is thy cauldron for thee, O Calbhach!’ ‘I accept it’, said the Calbhach. One of the pursuing party violently slung a stone which struck the bottom of the cauldron, by reason of which the army took to flight; and the Abbot's son was killed in the bog to the north of the town; and not only this, but their loss was not less than three hundred men from thence to Cluain-Aine in Crich-na-cedach, ut audimus from all in general, for this slaughter was continued from Cluain-imorruis to Cluain-Aine.

And he told Mac William to remain there, as he was not strong enongh to give battle or encounter to the Connachtmen; ‘for if we are slain’, *said he*, ‘it is agreeable to us that thou

Mac Diarmada and his kinsmen brought Mac William Burk, i.e. Rickard O'Cuairseidh, Ruaidhri Mac Diarmada's part of the country, and observed neither covenant nor equality towards him. The country was destroyed by Mac William, both church and territory; and he did no good in the country; but he destroyed it, and left it unquiet on his departure. Sligech was occupied on this occasion by Mac William, who left his son in its wardship. After the departure of Mac William out of Magh-Luirg, however, and after he had been three nights at Ard-Laodhach, wasting and plundering the churches and the artisans of Mac Diarmada, Ruaidhri Mac Diarmada came into the country, and placed his creaghts around Ard-Carna, and from thence to Buill on every side; and he himself went upon Cruachan, and was proclaimed lord in the face of Conchobhar, son of Conchobhar Mac Diarmada. And the Rock was afterwards taken by him; and he was in the government of the country from thenceforth. And Mac Diarmada's only son, i.e. Tadhg, the son of Conchobhar Mac Diarmada, was killed on the Rock, moreover, on this occasion, by a shot of an arrow.

Then it was that these two great armies advanced towards each other about Corr-sliabh; and they attempted not to separate from each other until a great number of their heroes and warriors fell in that fight. O'Domhnaill was defeated on this occasion, however, and eight hundred of his people, or more, were slain; and Fedhlim, the son of Maghnus O'Conchobhair, i.e. half-king of Connacht from Corr-sliabh to Drobhais, was taken prisoner there; and the two Mac Suibhnes were taken prisoners there. And the quantity of spoils of arms, horses, clothing, and all kinds of weapons and battle-dresses besides, that were captured there on this occasion, cannot be calculated or over-reckoned. And O'Domhnaill himself escaped from this defeat, through the effect of his courage, and the strength of his arm. And Mac Diarmada carried off his captives, and his numerous spoils, after gaining triumph.

O'Neill assembled a large army to one place; and Mac William of Clann-Rickard, i.e. Rickard, the son of Ulick, son of Ulick, son of Ulick-an-fhiona, and the Foreigners and Gaeidhel of Connacht, and O'Cerbhaill, and the descendants of O'Briain, came to join his muster; and they promised to meet one another in Tir-Conaill. And this Connacht army came to Sligech; and O'Neill came to Cenel-Móain, having an expeditionary force of Albanachs, along with the son of Mac Domhnaill, i.e. Alexander, and a great number of the Foreigners of Midhe, and of the Lagenian **gallowglasses**. As regards O'Domhnaill and the Cenel-Conaill, since they had not as many men as either of these two armies, the resolution they adopted was to make a night attack on O'Neill; and they made infantry of their cavalry, along with their battalions. And O'Neill was encamped at Cnoc-an-Bhobha; and the Conallachs with one accord

attacked them, without foreign assistance; and they defeated O'Neill that night; and a great number of his people were slain, both of the men of Alba and Erinn, and especially several of the Foreigners of Midhe, and of the Lagenian **gallowglasses**, and the Clann-Síthigh. And O'Neill retreated in disarray, after the destruction of his people, whilst O'Domhnaill returned triumphant, with a great quantity of spoils, horses, mail-armour, and weapons. And they *O'Neill's forces* rested not until they encamped at Benn-Gulbain. And the two Mac Williams, and the two O'Conchobhairs, and Mac Diarmada, and O'Cerbhaill, and the descendants of O' Briain, were around Sligech with a large army; and when they received certain intelligence that this defeat had been given to O' Neill, though great the number of guards and men that were there, they turned back to their homes; and O'Domhnaill did not know of their departure until they had crossed Corr-sliabh; and that military alliance was humbled on that occasion.

but remained about Maghnus O'Domhnaill, (for he did not come in this great army, because he was in discord with his father). And the Clann-Súibhne, and O'Baighill, with their warlike and valorous bands, came also in this muster of O'Domhnaill; as was the custom with them. This charmed, ready, army moved late in the day from Ath-Senaigh, and occupied a resting place and encampment between Dubh and Drobhais. And after they had eaten their food, they sent watchers and sentinels to guard the army from the danger of a camp attack being made upon them by the Síl-Conchobhair, with their muster; for they were assembled in one piece in Sligech, and had promised battle to O'Domhnaill, And the first who went on the watch was O'Baighill; for he thought that he might find some of his opponents and adversaries, in Lower Connacht, coming to make a camp attack on this army of O'Domhnaill. And Aedh Buidhe O'Domhnaill's people went on the watch in like manner; and O'Baighill and they encountered each other in the twilight of the early morning. And the people of O'Domhnaill's son advanced against, and towards, O'Baighill with his cavalry, taking them for a party belonging to Lower Connacht. It was not with fear, nor with a desire to flee, that O'Baighill received this attack of his enemies, (for he was positively certain that it was they who were approaching him); but O'Baighill made a vehement, sudden rush towards them, and to meet them; and he stayed not under their protection, but went unguardedly amongst them, so that he received his death miserably, unfortunately, by his own true friends. And a very great loss to paupers and orphans, to the infirm and to professors, was this eminent man, i.e. Niall O'Baighill. This great calamity, however did not prevent O'Domhnaill from attempting,

and continuing to pass that way; and after the approach of day he goes as far as Findir; and he rested and remained in that place until the rising of the sun on the morrow. The cavalry of Cathal Og's son, viz., Muinter-Airt, advance towards Braghad-Chuillidh. They meet some of the cavalry of the army, and both parties proceed to attack each other in Belach-Dúin-iarainn. A horseman of Muinter-Airt is slain in this conflict, and they separate from one another. O'Domhnaill remains in his own encampment that night; and he rises in the morning following, and goes to Fersad-ranna-in-liagain, to go across it into Cuil-irra. O'Conchobhair was in Sligech, with his muster, arraying his people to go against O'Domhnaill to Fersad-ranna-in-liagain, (where Liagán, a heroic warrior of the Fomorians, was killed by Lugh Lamhfada, when coming to the battle of Magh-Tuiredh, where the Fomorians were imposing their tributes on the men of Erinn for a long time before that—so that it was from him this ford was named). And whilst the full tide was in the ford these armies were taking an estimate of each other; and the resolution which O'Conchobhair adopted was, since he had not as many men as O'Domhnaill, and as O'Domhnaill had put his forces in order, and fixed his great gun in front of the ford, not to oppose him at the ford, *but to wait* until he would find him unprepared in another place. O'Domhnaill goes across the ford, when he found it without defence, without protection; and a number of the chieftains of Lower Connacht go to demand battle from O'Domhnaill's people.

This demand had scarcely been responded to, when they proudly, furiously, attacked each other. A person of very great note of the Clann-Donnchaidh was killed in this conflict, i.e. Maelsechlainn, the son of Tadhg, son of Ruaidhri; and by a shot of a gun he was killed. Another horseman of O'Domhnaill's people was killed there by a cast of a spear, i.e. James Ballach, the son of Niall, son of John. They separate from each other. O'Domhnaill goes into the country of Brian O'Conchobhair's descendants, and was three nights destroying corn, and burning towns and moors. O'Conchobhair was at Bel-an-droichit in an encampment. O'Domhnaill goes across the 

strand westwards to Tir-Fiachrach-Muaidhe, and destroys therein a great quantity of corn, and many towns, and much of every other kind of property; for the country was in their own power, except some of its castles; and he seized a great quantity of the herds of the country around Sliabh-Gamh. They proceed westwards across the Muaidh, at the invitation of the descendants of Richard Burk, in pursuit of some of the herds of the sons of O'Dubhda. The daughter of Walter Burk is seized by them, i.e. the wife of Eoghan O'Dubhda, together with his prey. So immense were the spoils and herds obtained by O'Domhnaill, that a beef, or two beeves would be given there for one **bonn**, and even this would not be got for them. Mac Diarmada, and the sons of Tadhg Mac Diarmada, and the sons of Mac David, went to assist those of Lower *Connacht* against O'Domhnaill. O'Domhnaill turns back, after accomplishing his expedition and journey into that country as he wished; and those chieftains of Lower Connacht were prepared to give battle to O'Domhnaill on his return home; but they only made a slight attack, for O'Domhnaill rested not from the time he left Tir-Fiachrach until he went to Druim-cliabh; and 

he was always in battle array during that time. A

of the large towns, and of Midhe, both ecclesiastical and lay, and all the Saxons that were in 

Erinn, and the fleets that were in the harbours on each side of them, i.e. at least a very 

large fleet which was on Cairlinne. And these musters of the Justiciary came up with the Gaeidhelic

not succeeded in getting into proper array; nor did they act on the counsel of their

These acts were not endured by Mac Diarmada, i.e. by Brian, son of Ruaidhri Mac Diarmada: i.e. he began to disturb and confound his enemies, and boldly to plunder his adversaries, on account of his father, so that he preyed and burned Muinter-Flannagain entirely, and the Cluainte altogether; for he left neither a corn-field without cutting, nor a house without burning, on Sliabh-Bádhna, or on either side of it.

Clann-Maelruanaidh, and some more of the districts and fair territories of Connacht, both

And hence it was to praise him after his death the poet uttered these words, to illustrate his bounty, his intelligence, and his generosity, when he said,

satire or reproach, censure or malediction, rebuke or envy; who spent his sovereignty and 

great lordship, his wealth and large property, according to the desire of his own great heart. But, though it would be excessive to relate, and copious to completely illustrate, and though the most learned could not calculate, the power of his sovereignty over the districts and fair territories throughout the greater part of Connacht, both ecclesiastical and lay, he left not the value of one groat of inheritance; but he earned the blessing of patrons and ecclesiastics, poets and doctors, the poor and widows, strangers and orphans, the infirm and pilgrims, martyrs, and victims of heavy sickness, guests and exiles, for himself, and for his posterity, and heirs. He obtained, moreover, prodigious bounty and gifts from the elect Trinity, viz., illness without pain, without oppression, without anguish, without horror, and the command of his own sense, memory, reason, and understanding until he experienced pure penance, and great penitence for 

his faults, after spending nearly eighty years. And three score years of this period he was abbot in Trinity Island on Loch-Cé, and on Loch-uachtair, and nineteen years chief lord over all the territories of the Clann-Maelruanaidh; and the half of every year of these he spent in an encampment on Machaire-Connacht, in despite of many of the Foreigners and Gaeidhel of Erinn, and of all other neighbours; (or it was forty-two years, perhaps, Mac Diarmada spent in that manner); and the

place in which his fortified camp was wont to be during that time was near Sceithin-na-cend, and near Fuaran-Gar, and near Imaire-Maighe-hAi, and on each side of them. But the disease from which there is no escape, and which cannot be avoided, attacked him, and he died after communion, after mass, and after precept, on Maunday Thursday, on Carraig-Mic-Diarmada; and his body was nobly, honourably, interred in the abode of the saints, and the bed of the patrons, i.e. in Trinity-Island, as he himself had ordered that he should be buried in the sepulchre of the preceding abbots, to exhibit, and manifest, his wisdom and knowledge and to renounce pride, and to magnify the honour of the church after him. His soul afterwards journeyed to the general Pasch without end or limit, in saecula saeculorum. Amen. It was for him, therefore, the author composed the stanza,

O'Conchobhair Donn, and his Albanachs, were in Magh-Luirg before them, 

levying tributes on every *side*, and on Magh-Luirg 

especially, for they had Mac Diarmada's permission thereto. Brian son of 

Ruaidhri was not, nor were his kinsmen, acting with O'Conchobhair about that 

time; and Brian did not know that O'Conchobhair was acting treacherously, 

until he himself proved his treachery, i.e. until he apprehended Diarmaid, 

son of Ruaidhri Mac Diarmada, and Tomaltach Og, son of Tomaltach Mac 

Diarmada, after they had sided with O'Conchobhair's people, and until their 

horses and armour were taken from them. Tomaltach Og escaped in the course 

of some time after that. A ransom was exacted from Diarmaid. His stud, and 

some of his herds, were afterwards taken from Brian Mac Diarmada, by those 

Albanachs of O'Conchobhair. Brian himself was lying in pain during all that 

time. On his recovery, he took cows and horses from O'Conchobhair. The son

Clann-Faghartaigh; and they took from him two thousand cows, and more, with 

a proportionate number of horses, and returned safely. The President was 

this time in Cuilecha. Messengers went to meet him from Brian, to complain 

to him of those deeds. These reports were not neglected by the President, 

with his Foreigners, for he made no stay, or delay, until he came into 

Clann-Connmhaidh. Brian Mac Miarmada, and the sons of Tomaltach Mac 

Diarmada, went to meet him in Clann-Connmhaidh; and he sent Brian on before 

him again to Magh-Luirg, to watch Mac Diarmada and the Albanachs, and he 

himself remained after him in Clann-Connmhaidh that night; and they

The son of Maurice Dubh, son of the Earl 

of Des-Mumha, came to Erinn in this year, and a few Spaniards along with 

him. They occupied Dun-in-óir in Mumha; and when the Justiciary of Erinn 

heard this he assembled a large army, viz., the Earl of Cill-dara, and 

Captain Malbie, i.e. the governor of the province of Connacht at that time, 

and a great number of the Gaeidhel of Connacht, and the province of Laighen, 

with its armament, and a great number of Muimhnechs. When the sons of the 

Earl of Des-Mumha, viz., John, the son of James, and Shemus-na-tinol, his 

other brother, heard that James, the son of Maurice Dubh, had come to Erinn, 

accompanied by the Spaniards, they raised an insurrection of war, against 

the Foreigners of Mumha; and the president of the two provinces of Mumha, 

and eight of the principal Foreigners along with him, were killed in their 

own territory. James, the son of Maurice Dubh, went on an expedition into 

the country of Clann-William. The Clann-William of the Suir, i.e. the 

posterity of the Red Earl, overtook him. They fought with each other. The 

son of Maurice Dubh fell there; and three of the Clann-William fell with 

him. And he endured much hardship by sea and land up to that time, 

throughout Spain and France, making preparations against his enemies, and 

performed great bravery, and warlike deeds, in those foreign countries, for 

the sake of his own land, and of the faith.

bishop, and a friar minor of noble blood, to death in an unbecoming manner.

A great army was sent to Lower Connacht by the governor of the province of

Mac Domhnaill, of the Albanachs, and Thomas Odis, an eminent captain of the 

Saxons, and William Clifford, and Captain Morna, and the sheriff of the 

county of Sligech, i.e. Brian, the son of Tadhg O'Ruairc. And there were 

five or six hundred Albanachs with the sons of Domhnall Ballagh Mac 

Domhnall. And all Saxons that were along with these captains went into the 

county of Sligech. O'Conchobhair Sligigh spread them over the county. Soon 

after that Sligigh entreated all the Saxon captains that were there to join 

him. The chieftains and nobles of all Lower Connacht, along with O'Conchobhair

Sligigh and those Saxons, attacked the Albanachs, and the sons of Domhnall 

Ballagh; and Alasdar, the son of Domhnall Ballagh Mac Domhnaill, i.e., the most 

hopefully regarded and bravely distinguished son of an Albanach that had 

come into Connacht for a long time, was killed there at Bun-an-fedáin, by 

O'Conchobhair Sligigh and the Saxons, in revenge of Cathal Og O'Conchobhair, 

and in revenge of the persons slain along with him a short time before that. In fine, one or two hundred of the Albanachs, and 

more, were slain in that defeat, wherever they were throughout the county. 

And Domhnall Conn, son of Domhnall Ballagh, escaped

from this destruction. And the quantity of horses taken there, and of coats 

of mail, arms, and ordnance, and of all other spoils besides, cannot be 

calculated or over-reckoned. And though some say that this deed was not 

right, it cannot be said that O'Conchobhair was not justified in his own 

share of it, for his anger against them had not cooled since the fall of his 

brother, and his constable, and his good men, by them before that; and there 

was neither peace nor promise between them afterwards; for it was on the 

Wednesday before Dardain-álainn of Corpus Christi that Cathal Og fell, with 

those who were along with him; and between Christmas and Brigid's festival 

the Albanachs, and the son of Domhnall Ballagh, were slain; although they

Great depredations were committed by the sons of the Earl of 

Clann-Rickard, viz., Ulick and John, upon the descendants of Ulick Burk, and

the son of the Earl, and by Redmond, son of Ulick-na-gcenn, and by Redmond, 

the bishop's son, on the Earl's son John; for the two Redmonds gave him an 

invitation; and they took him to Bél-atha-Finntainn, and drew the Earl, i.e.,

Mac Suibhne, and John, the son of Brian Mac Gilla-Cellaigh, and Finghin

The governor, and the Earl of Clann-Rickard, and the Earl of Tuadh-Mumha,

themselves had in their hands for a long time before that, viz., the son of

the Blind Abbot, and the son of Meiler, son of Walter Fada, and the son of

John Burk: and that was a pitiful deed—the hanging of the innocent

children. And they killed Eoghan, the son of Domhnall-an-chogaidh

O'Flaithbhertaigh, per dolum, and killed and hanged

several of his people. And the army that committed those deeds brought three

The sons of James Mac Domhnaill came to Erinn, *with* fifteen hundred

Albanachs; and they destroyed much in Uladh. And they went to Cill-Ronain in

the territory of Connacht, and were five nights in it; and the governor was

at Bel-an-atha-fada, a numerous host of the chieftains of Connacht, and of

Saxons, being with him. And the Albanachs retreated to Cul-mhaine; and some

of the Clann-William came to meet them; and they advanced to

Droiched-in-chillín. And when the Saxons heard that the Albanachs had

gone past them down, they followed them; and they encountered one another at

Droiched-in-chilín, and delivered a vigorous battle to each other

there; and five or six of the governor's horses were killed; and the

Albanachs departed uninjured to Sliabh-damh, and carried a prey with them to

Ard-na-riadh. As regards the governor, he was rendered furious and fully

angry at the escape of the Albanachs from him, and he permitted all the

'rising out' of the Gaeidhil that he had to depart, and returned southwards

towards the Caislén-mór. And two Saxon


---

companies that came from Mumha overtook him there; and he had then seven

companies of the best army in the world; and he followed them nobly,

valiantly, vigorously, until he reached Ard-na-riadh. And when the Albanachs

saw them approaching they advanced from the town to meet and encounter the

Foreigners, and discharged vehement, furious, showers from their firearms

against the Foreigners; and such was the misfortune of the Albanachs, that

they wounded neither man nor horse with that discharge, and that they

commenced a movement of rout and flight towards the Muaidh, and that twenty

hundred, or more, were killed and drowned. James Mac Domhnaill's two sons

were killed there, viz., Domhnall Gorm and Alaster; and Gilla-espuig, son of

Dubhghall, son of Donnchadh Cam MacAilin, was slain there; and Edmond

Kiocarach, son of David Bán Burk, and Cathair, son of Domhnall, son

of Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Domhnaill, were slain there, and many more whom we

cannot reckon, from their number. And in Ard-na-riadh this slaughter was

given, a week before the festival of Michael. And a battle was fought in

Flanders on that day, between king Philip and the queen of the Saxons.

Philip, the son of Sir Henry, was slain in that battle, and several

others.
