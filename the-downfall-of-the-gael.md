#### Notes

This is Ferguson's translation of the seventeenth-century poem 'Mo thruaighe mar táid Gaoidhil' by Fearflatha Ó Gnímh. Fearflatha was head of the Ó Gnímhs, who were hereditary poets to the O'Neills of Clandeboye, in the modern area Antrim and Down. His floruit was between 1602 and 1638, and the poem was his answer to the collapse of the Gaelic Order with the Flight of the Earls on 14 September 1607. The Irish poem is available at CELT in file G402568, no. 55.

### The Downfall of the Gael: Author: Samuel Ferguson




---

p.38


### O'Gnive, bard of O'Neill

1. My heart is in woe,
  
And my soul deep in trouble, —
  
For the mighty are low,
  
And abased are the noble:
2. The Sons of the Gael
  
Are in exile and mourning,
  
Worn, weary and pale
  
As spent pilgrims returning;
3. Or men who, in flight
  
From the field of disaster,
  
Beseech the black night
  
On their flight to fall faster;
4. Or seamen aghast
  
When their planks gape asunder,
  
And the waves fierce and fast
  
Tumble through in hoarse thunder;


---

p.39

7. Or men whom we see
  
That have got their death-omen, —
  
Such wretches are we
  
In the chains of our foemen!
8. Our courage is fear,
  
Our nobility vileness,
  
Our hope is despair,
  
And our comeliness foulness.
9. There is mist on our heads,
  
And a cloud chill and hoary
  
Of black sorrow, sheds
  
An eclipse on our glory.
10. From the Boyne to the Linn
  
Has the mandate been given,
  
That the children of Finn
  
From their country be driven.
11. That the sons of the king —
  
Oh, the treason and malice! —
  
Shall no more ride the ring
  
In their own native valleys;
12. No more shall repair
  
Where the hill foxes tarry,
  
Nor forth to the air
  
Fling the hawk at her quarry:
13. For the plain shall be broke
  
By the share of the stranger,
  
And the stone-mason's stroke
  
Tell the woods of their danger;


---

p.40

16. The green hills and shore
  
Be with white keeps disfigured,
  
And the Mote of Rathmore
  
Be the Saxon churl's haggard!
17. The land of the lakes
  
Shall no more know the prospect
  
Of valleys and brakes —
  
So transformed is her aspect!
18. The Gael cannot tell,
  
In the uprooted wild-wood
  
And the red ridgy dell,
  
The old nurse of his childhood:
19. The nurse of his youth
  
Is in doubt as she views him,
  
If the wan wretch, in truth,
  
Be the child of her bosom.
20. We starve by the board,
  
And we thirst amid wassail —
  
For the guest is the lord,
  
And the host is the vassal!
21. Through the woods let us roam,
  
Through the wastes wild and barren;
  
We are strangers at home!
  
We are exiles in Erin!
22. And Erin's a bark
  
O'er the wide waters driven!
  
And the tempest howls dark,
  
And her side planks are riven!


---

p.41

25. And in billows of might
  
Swell the Saxon before her, —
  
Unite, oh, unite!
  
Or the billows burst o'er her!
