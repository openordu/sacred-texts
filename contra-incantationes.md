### Contra Incantationes


The following scribal note is from MS 3 C 19, a copy of an Irish translation of the Lilium Medicinae, the Decem Ingenia, and Prognostica of **Bernard of Gordon** (for whom see Ériu 11, 174 ff). The translation was made by **Cormac Mac Duinn Shleibhe**, one of a noted Ulster family of physicians, about the middle of the fifteenth century. The scribe, **Risdeard Ó Conchubhair** (Richard O'Connor), came of a well-known family of physicians in Ossory. For other notes by him in this manuscript see Cat. of Irish MSS. in the Royal Irish Academy, pp. 1167 ff., and Father Paul Walsh's Gleanings from Irish MSS., 2nd ed., 123 ff. The scribal notes in these medical manuscripts are often of very great interest for their valuable commentary on contemporary events and for the information they give us about the kind of people the writers were; the environment in which they lived, their family connexions, and their own personal views on matters of public and historical interest. The earlier scribes of medical manuscripts were physicians — outstanding examples of this are the O'Connors of 3 C 19; and another interesting question arises out of the matter and style of some of the notes: Is it possible that some of these physicians were also in holy orders? The extract quoted below reads as though it might be the utterance not of a layman, but of an ecclesiastic. Certainly it is that of a man with a strong moral sense and a high degree of piety. The period in which **Richard O'Connor** lived was a difficult one for Irish priests, and it is interesting to consider whether he and other medical men of the Middle Ages in Ireland were not priests, as were many of their professional colleagues in England and on the continent. **Bernard of Gordon** himself was a very devout man, e.g. in the Preface to the Lilium Medicinae, quoting **Galen**: *No one can come nearer to God better than by study in the truth and for the truth. To the honour therefore of the heavenly Lamb who is the splendour and glory of the Father this book, entitled Lilium Medicinae. For in the lily there are many blooms and in each bloom seven white petals as it were

seven golden grains. This book likewise contains seven parts, of which the first will be golden, glowing and shining. For it will treat of many universal diseases, beginning with fevers . . .’’*

 Cf. the passage in Preface to Rosa Anglica where **John of Gaddesden** discusses his reasons for calling his book the Rose (ITS 25, pp. xxi, xxii). John himself was a priest, perhaps a canon. He held a stall in St. Paul's Cathedral. From **O'Connor**'s observations on the subject of his note printed here it is obvious that the trend of his mind was didactic. It shocked him that **Bernard** did not expressly condemn practices that involved attempts to interfere with the ways of Providence. His style also shows traces of scholastic influences. 


The note is inserted into chapter 14 (on the causes and cure of sterility), with a marginal warning that it is the scribe who is speaking (an sgribhneoir adeir so).


Winifred Wulff.

*Translation*
-------------


Now as regards charms it is a wonder to me that **Bernard** did not prescribe anything against them in this chapter, since he mentions them in his section on causes, and moreover that he did not write a special chapter on them, and more particularly I wonder that Cormac did not[1](javascript:footNote('G600015/note001.html')) do so, unless the reason was that they cannot be cured. And according to my own opinion it seems that they can be cured, like every other trial and temptation that the devil and his followers send on human beings. For followers of the devil and devils themselves are those who use them. If so, whosoever is sterile, man or woman, let him not be a heretic, etc., but let him believe as the Church believes, and let him make his confession often, and receive the Holy Sacrament of the Church, and hear the words and true teaching of God, and restore the things he got wrongly, nor have thoughts of committing the same wrong again. And let him give alms and pray and repent and fast, if he be one who can do so. And after this let him pray the merciful Father often that he may have children, for be it known to thee Joachim and Anna, Elizabeth and Zacharias, with whom God was pleased, and who were free from blame, received children from God through prayer. And not that only, but I have no doubt that whatever fitting petition a good Christian is wont to ask of God he will obtain it, ergo, etc. And understand, moreover, that even were there no charms, none the less is it right to do this. For God sends a disease which causes sterility as punishment on the sinner when he does not repent. Therefore until the sin be put away the disease which came by it will not be cured, and until the disease be cured there will be no generation from him,ergo, etc. And this ought to be understood in any other disease also. And the physician also should be pure from blame before he begins his works.
