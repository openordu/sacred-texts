Limerick, 14th August, 1691.
My lord—I have received your lordship's letter. I am sorry to tell you that my lord lieutenant *Tyrconnell* died this day about two of the clock. It was a fatal stroke to this poor country in this nick of time, the enemy being within four miles of the town. He is to be buried privately to-morrow, about ten of the clock at night. As he appeared always zealous for his country, so his loss at this time was extreme pernicious to the welfare of this poor nation. There was no need of making any use of the statute, for that the king sent over a commission along with Mr. Plowden, which was presented this day. The persons named justices are my lord chancellor, Mr. Plowden and myself. The power is as large as it was given to any other justices, but there are instructions that we shall leave the government and management of the army to the chief officer in command, who is now monsieur D'Usson. It was to me the greatest surprise in the world to find myself named therein, having indeed never expected it, but withal, in all the letters I received from the king, he made not the least mention of it; but I must submit, and certainly will do all I can for his majesty's service. God in his infinite mercy direct us all. I am, my lord, your lordship's most faithful, humble servant,—R. Nagle.
