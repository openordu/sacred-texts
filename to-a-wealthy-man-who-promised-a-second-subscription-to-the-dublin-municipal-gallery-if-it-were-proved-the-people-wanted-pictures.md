p.29


December 19121. You gave but will not give again
  
Until enough of Paudeen's pence
  
By Biddy's halfpennies have lain
  
To be 'some sort of evidence,'
  
Before you'll put your guineas down,
  
That things it were a pride to give
  
Are what the blind and ignorant town
  
Imagines best to make it thrive.
  
What cared Duke Ercole, that bid
  
His mummers to the market place,
  
What th' onion-sellers thought or did
  
So that his Plautus set the pace
  
For the Italian comedies?
  
And Guidobaldo, when he made

That grammar school of courtesies
  
Where wit and beauty learned their trade
  
Upon Urbino's windy hill,
  
Had sent no runners to and fro
  
That he might learn the shepherds' will.
  
And when they drove out Cosimo,
  
Indifferent how the rancour ran,
  
He gave the hours they had set free
  
To Michelozzo's latest plan
  
For the San Marco Library,
  
Whence turbulent Italy should draw
  
Delight in Art whose end is peace,
  
In logic and in natural law
  
By sucking at the dugs of Greece.
2. Your open hand but shows our loss,
  
For he knew better how to live.
  
Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss,
  
Look up in the sun's eye and give
  
What the exultant heart calls good

p.31


That some new day may breed the best
  
Because you gave, not what they would
  
But the right twigs for an eagle's nest!
