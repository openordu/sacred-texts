**George Clarke** to **Sir Theobald Butler**
--------------------------------------------


Sir,—
I send you the enclosed, which any persons you may think fit may compare with the copy remaining in the office, and witness for the satisfaction of your friends, but the lords justices and general having sent to the king for leave to rectify the omission, think it inconsistent. With the respect they owe to his majesty to take upon them to do it before they receive his answer, as they conceive they should in effect, if an attested copy is given out of the office. I am sorry this should create any trouble to you, which I would prevent with all my heart and so would their lordships, as you may know more fully from themselves, if you will speak with them. —


***George Clarke**.*

By the lords justices of Ireland.—**Charles Porter**, **Thomas Coningsby**.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


We do hereby order and direct you not to deliver any foul drafts of the articles lately concluded with the Irish, nor show any copy or copies of letters that we have *written* upon that subject before or since the signing of the same, to any person whatsoever. Given at the camp of **Limerick**, this 7th day of October, 1691.


To **George Clarke, esq., secretary at war**.


Memorandum:
-----------


This is the original draft of the articles of **Limerick** in **Ireland**, which were signed October third, 1691. But in transcribing the fair copy which was actually signed, **Mr. Payzant**, my clerk, in whose hand the body of the articles are wrote, left out in the second article these words, viz.: and all such as are under their protection in those counties. This was not known till the day after, when **sir Theobald Butler** and another of the commissioners from the city of **Limerick** came to me: but the mistake could not be corrected at that time, because **general Ginkel**'s son was actually gone upon his journey to England with the articles, as signed. Afterwards the Irish had the advantage given them of this omission by a broad seal and an act of parliament; and, indeed, it was but just, for those words, viz., all such as are under their protection, etc., were agreed upon to be part of the articles at the very first meeting with the commissioners from the city. The words interlined are in **sir Theobald Butler**'s hand.—


**George Clarke**.
