### Address of Irish Commandants to the President and Congress of the United States: Author: Irish Commandants (whose signatures are appended)


The following address was drafted on June 18th, 1917, by Republican Commandants who arrived on that day from England, where they had been prisoners since 1916. It was brought to the United States by Dr. Patrick McCartan and publicly received at

the Capitol by Secretary Tumulty.

*Dublin, Ireland*

June 18, 1917
Gentlemen:


We, the undersigned, who have been held in English prisons and have

been dragged from dungeon to dungeon, in heavy chains, cut off, since

Easter Week, 1916, from all intercourse with the outside world, have

just had an opportunity of seeing the printed text of the message of

the United States of America to the Provisional Government of

Russia.


We see that the President accepts as the aim of both countries

‘the carrying of the present struggle for the freedom of all peoples

to a successful consummation’. We, also, see that the object of

President Wilson's own government is ‘the liberation of peoples

everywhere from the aggressions of autocratic force’. ‘We are

fighting,’ writes the President to the Government of Russia, ‘for

the liberty, self-government, and undictated development of all

peoples, and every feature of the settlement that concludes this war

must be conceived and executed for that purpose. Wrongs must first be

righted, and then adequate safeguards must be created to prevent their

being committed again. Remedies must be found as well as statements of

principle that will have a pleasing and sonorous sound . . . No people must be forced under a sovereignty under

which it does not wish to live.’


We trust that such remedies—in preference to any governmental

professions whatsoever—will be held to include the right of each

people, not merely to rely on other peoples to support their claim to

national liberty, but what the Governments and peoples of other

nations will, we trust, regard as even more sacred, the right of each

people to defend itself against external aggression, external

interference and external control. It is this particular right that we

claim for the Irish people, and not content with statements of

principle, though these themselves may be made a pretext for our

oppression, we are engaged and mean to engage ourselves in practical

means for establishing this right.


Without awaiting the issue of the war or the settlement that may

conclude the war, we ask of the Government of the United States of

America, and the Governments of the free peoples of the world, to take

immediate measures to inform themselves accurately and on the

spot about the extent of liberty or attempted repression which we may

encounter.


We, the undersigned, are officers (just released from English

prisons) of forces formed independently in Ireland to secure the

complete liberation of the Irish Nation.
