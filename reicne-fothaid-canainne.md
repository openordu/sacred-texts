p.5


There once was a leader of fiana over the men of Connacht, even Fothad Canainne. He and Fothad Airctech and Fothad Cairptech were brothers. This was why they were called the Fothads, because they were fotha suith, 'a foundation of offspring'; for they were the first children whom Fuinche bore to Macnia. Or Fothad, viz., fo-táide, i.e. by stealth were they begotten by Macnia upon Fuinche the daughter of Nár son of Armair.[1](javascript:footNote('T303016/note001.html')) Or, Fothad, viz., fí-aeda, i.e. venom of fire, for they were a virulent fire in destroying clans and races. Oendia (‘one god’[2](javascript:footNote('T303016/note002.html'))), however, and Tréndia (‘strong god’) and Cáindia (‘fair god’) were their names. Oendia was Airctech, Trendia was Cairptech, Caindia was Fothad Canann.


At one birth they were all three brought forth by Fuinche, daughter of Nár. She lay in by Lugaid mac Con, ut alii dicunt. Fuinche brought forth Oendia at nightfall. He is so called, because he was a king's son, for the excellence of the lucky hour. Trendia was born at midnight. The name was given to him for the strength of luck with the gods at that hour.[3](javascript:footNote('T303016/note003.html')) Caindia *was born* in the morning. Because of the loveliness and the beauty of the dawn of morning, therefore Caindia is his name. Of them the shanachie has sung:—


> 1. The three Fothads of Ireland without a blemish,
>   
> three sons of Lugaid, Garrchú's son:
>   
> before the men were *called* Fothad,
>   
> what were their names to show *them* forth?
> 2. Oendia and Cáindia the champion,
>   
> and Tréndia, I hide it not:
>   
> those are—they teach renown—
>   
> the names truly of the Fothads.
> 3. Oendia was Airctech of the clans,
>   
> and Cáindia was Fothad Canann,
>   
> Tréndia was Cairptech, you see,
>   
>   
> [*...*]  
>  with the High-king
> Three F.
>

p.7


According to others they were called Fothad, as it were fó-suit, i.e. fo means ‘good’, viz., they were good foundations, i.e. a distinguished progeny. Fothad Canann is so called from Canann, a houndthat he had; whence *also* Canann[4](javascript:footNote('T303016/note004.html')) in Mag Life is called. Or Fothad Cáinine, viz. cáin, i.e. delightful was the day when he was born.


Fothad Aircthech *‘the silvery’* is so called because wealth was dearest to him; for that was his champion's bracelet and his two rings and his neck-torque.[5](javascript:footNote('T303016/note005.html'))


Fothad Cairptech *‘of the chariots’* is so called because this is the portion that he used to give *to his sons*, steeds with their chariots. And he was *also* called Fothad Dolus[6](javascript:footNote('T303016/note006.html')).


This Fothad Canainne was noble and ingenious. He was the diadem of a household and of a host. He had a war-band *fian* of famous warriors, who were distingished for dress and terror and dignity and raiment and fierceness beyond the warriors of that time.


There was also at that time a famous leader of fiana in Munster, even Ailill Flann Bec. There was mutual strife between them on both sides; and they made raids upon each other. Fothad's shape was more marvellous than that of Ailill, but Ailill's wife was more marvellous and delightful than Fothad's wife. Then Failbe was sent by[7](javascript:footNote('T303016/note007.html')) Fothad to woo Ailill's wife in disregard of her husband. She said that she would not go with them until he should give her bride-price to her. She fixed her bride-price, even a bushel of gold and a bushel of silver and a bushel of white bronze. Failbe reports that answer to Fothad. Fothad said she should have that. The woman asked [*...*][8](javascript:footNote('T303016/note008.html')) she would take it in whatever form it was offered (?). He said that each man of Fothad's household had six rivets in his spear, viz. two rivets of gold and two rivets of silver and two rivets of white bronze; and they would take three rivets out of every spear and leave three rivets in every spear, and *thus* three bushels would be filled with them, even a bushel of gold, and a bushel of silver, and a bushel of bronze.

So she came to a tryst with Fothad and he carried her off. However, Ailill Flann Bec went with all his warrior-bands *fiana* in pursuit of his wife, so that he encountered Fothad the same night. They fought a battle with their two warrior-bands.[9](javascript:footNote('T303016/note009.html')) They had sworn that they would overthrow each other. Fothad falls there and is beheaded. The woman who comes to a tryst with Fothad carries his head to him in the grave where it is. Then the head of Fothad sang the reicne to the woman and said:—
  

‘Hush, woman, do not speak to me, &c.’
