In the name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred,


We, the people of Éire,


Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our
Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries
of trial,


Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting
struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation,


And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence,
Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual
may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country
restored, and concord established with other nations,


Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.

Stát,


Ar mbeith dúinne, muintir na hÉireann,
ag admháil go huiríseal a mhéid atáimid faoi
chomaoin ag Íosa Críost, ár dTiarna Dia, a thug
comhfhurtacht dár sinsir i ngach cruatan ina rahhadar ar feadh na

Agus ar mbeith dúinn á chur romhainn

of such law in each of the official languages, both the signed texts shall be enrolled for
record in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and the text, or both the texts, so
enrolled shall be conclusive evidence of the provisions of such law.

of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law.




---

p.130


Where the body of a person alleged to be unlawfully detained is produced before the High Court in pursuance of an order in that behalf made under this section and that Court is satisfied that such person is being detained in accordance with a law but that such law is invalid having regard to the provisions of this Constitution, the High Court shall refer the
question of the validity of such law to the Supreme Court by way of case stated and may, at the time of such reference or at any time thereafter, allow the said person to be at liberty on such bail and subject to such conditions as the High Court shall fix until the Supreme Court
has determined the question so referred to it.


The High Court before which the body of a person alleged to be unlawfully
detained is to be produced in pursuance of an order in that behalf made under this section shall, if the President of the High Court or, if he is not available, the senior judge of that Court who is available so directs in respect of any particular case, consist of three judges and shall, in every other case, consist of one judge only.




---

p.132


Where an order is made under this section by the High Court or a judge thereof
for the production of the body of a person who is under sentence of death, the High Court or
such judge thereof shall further order that the execution of the said sentence of death shall
be deferred until after the body of such person has been produced before the High Court and the
lawfulness of his detention has been determined and if, after such deferment, the detention of
such person is determined to be lawful, the High Court shall appoint a day for the execution of
the said sentence of death and that sentence shall have effect with the substitution of the day
so appointed for the day originally fixed for the execution thereof.

p.134


1. The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.
  

The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism
of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.
  

The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.
2. The right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms.
  

Provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public and to prevent or control meetings in the vicinity of either House of the Oireachtas.
3. The right of the citizens to form associations and unions.


---

p.136


  

Laws, however, may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the foregoing right.

and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class
discrimination.

Nation and the State.


In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman
gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.

home.

on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.


No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of
marriage.

but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the
jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable
of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party
to the marriage so dissolved.

and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral,
intellectual, physical and social education of their children.


Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private
schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.


The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful
preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular
type of school designated by the State.


The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of
actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual
and social.


The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to
supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative, and, when
the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions with due
regard, however, for the rights of parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral
formation.




---

p.142


In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.


### Private Property.


#### Article 43.


The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the
natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.


The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right
of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.


The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the
foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles
of social justice.

The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of
the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common
good.

The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the
ground of religious profession, belief or status.


Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between
schools under the management of different religious denominations,

public money without attending religious instruction at that school.


Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs,
own, acquire and administer property, movable and immovable, and maintain institutions for
religious or charitable purposes.


The property of any religious denomination or any educational institution shall
not be diverted save for necessary works of public utility and on payment of
compensation.


### DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL POLICY.


#### Article 45.


The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for
the general guidance of the Oireachtas. The application of those
principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas
exclusively, and shall not be cognisable by any Court under any of the provisions of this
Constitution.




---

p.148


The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing
and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall
inform all the institutions of the national life.


The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing:— 
1. That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.
2. That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.
3. That, especially, the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment.


---

p.150

6. That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.
7. That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.

industry and commerce.


The State shall endeavour to secure that private enterprise shall be so
conducted as to ensure reasonable efficiency in the production and distribution of goods and as
to protect the public against unjust exploitation.

of the weaker sections of the community, and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of
the infirm, the widow, the orphan, and the aged.




---

p.152

men and women, and the tender age of children shall not be abused and that citizens shall not

strength.
