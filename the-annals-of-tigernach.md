of Church. At the end of fourteen years of the lordship of the king, that convention was commenced in Peter's place in Rome, and this is the final resolution to which they came: they appointed Mellito and Johannes and Augustinus to teach and preach in Britain and in England and in the province. And God heard their intercessions and their requests, and wrought for them great miracles and marvels, and sent with them many godly, holy monks; and these sowed belief and devotion in the provinces into which they were sent. And on that occasion Aethelbert the king turned to the Faith, and all the province with him, and he was made a bishop; and the Saxons believed in Augustinus, and 'tis he that was bishop in London. And Gregory sent writings to Augustinus to give him the rank of archbishop. At the end of twelve years after his coming from the east the rank of archbishop was conferred upon him.

A hosting by the Foreigners of Dublin and Tulach Aird *led* by Miles Cogan into Connacht without any previous warning. They reached Roscommon and there they remained three nights. Then Murchadh son of Ruaidhrí comes to them and goes as their guide before them throughout Connacht.


Howbeit, Ruaidhrí Ó Conchobhair, king of Ireland, tarried in the west of Connacht on his royal progress when the news of the Foreigners reached him. The Foreigners burned the plain *of Connacht* before them, and Ailfind and Ferta Gégi and Imlech Fordeorach, and Imlech mBroccada and Dún Imdain. And they came to Áth Moga and into Fid Manach and into the causeway of Móin Conneda, and into the high road of Lecc Gnathail and over Áth Tine near Dunmore, and direct to Tuam. And they made neither plunder nor onset throughout the province, for the folk of Connacht (with their cattle and other property) had fled into their fastnesses. And Tuam was emptied, and Cell {folio 26b2}Beneóin was burned, as well as Cell Medóin and Leccach and

Cell Chathgaile and Ross Cáim and the castle of Bun Gaillme. And the Foreigners were three nights in Tuam without food without profit. And they were told that the men of Connacht and Munster were gathering towards them, and the Foreigners perceived that this was true, for Ruaidhrí, the king of Ireland, did not allow them to lift a head till the place of battle was given them. The Foreigners fled till they reached the causeway of Móin Conneda, and the recruits of Connaught made an attack upon them as they were coming into the cause, and they would have been broken had not Ó Conchobhair's son been speeding them. That night they reached Uarán. On the morrow they continued their retreat to Áth Liac and ther a few Connachtmen overtook them, and the panic they caused in the ford was painful; and until they left Connacht they did not know the extent of their loss.
