### Carolan

1. Brightest blossom of the Spring,
  
Grace, the sprightly girl I sing:
  
Grace, who bore the palm of mind
  
From all the rest of womankind.
  
Whomsoe'er the fates decree,
  
Happy fate! for life to be
  
Day and night my Coolun near.
  
Ache or pain need never fear!
2. Her neck outdoes the stately swan,
  
Her radiant face the summer dawn:
  
Ah, happy thrice the youth for whom
  
The fates design that branch of bloom!
  
Pleasant are your words benign,
  
Rich those azure eyes of thine:
  
Ye who see my queen, beware
  
Those twisted links of golden hair!
3. This is what I fain would say
  
To the bird-voiced lady gay, —
  
Never yet conceived the heart
  
Joy which Grace cannot impart:
  
Fold of jewels! case of pearls!
  
Coolun of the circling curls!
  
More I say not, but no less
  
Drink you health and happiness!
