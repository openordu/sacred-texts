### The Dolls: Author: William Butler Yeats

p.78


1. A doll in the doll-maker's house
  
Looks at the cradle and balls:
  
'That is an insult to us.'
  
But the oldest of all the dolls
  
Who had seen, being kept for show.
  
Generations of his sort,
  
Out-screams the whole shelf: 'Although
  
There's not a man can report
  
Evil of this place,
  
The man and the woman bring
  
Hither to our disgrace,
  
A noisy and filthy thing.'

The doll-maker's wife is aware
  
Her husband has heard the wretch,
  
And crouched by the arm of his chair,

p.79


She murmurs into his ear,
  
Head upon shoulder leant:
  
'My dear, my dear, oh dear,
  
It was an accident.'
