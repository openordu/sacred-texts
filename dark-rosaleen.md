#### Notes


This poem first appeared in the National, 30th May 1846. It is based on an unrhymed version given in Samuel Ferguson's articles on Hardiman's Irish Minstrelsy in the Dublin University Magazine, 1834. The original, by Costello of Ballyhaunis, was evidently a love poem. (D.J. O'Donoghue.)

p.3


[1](javascript:footNote('E840000-001/note001.html'))[2](javascript:footNote('E840000-001/note002.html'))1. O my Dark Rosaleen,
  
Do no sigh, do not weep!
  
The priests are on the ocean green,
  
They march along the Deep.
  
There's wine . . . from the royal Pope
  
Upon the ocean green;
  
And Spanish ale shall give you hope,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My own Rosaleen!
  
Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope,
  
Shall give you health, and help, and hope,
  
My Dark Rosaleen.
2. Over hills and through dales
  
Have I roamed for your sake;
  
All yesterday I sailed with sails
  
On river and on lake.
  
The Erne . . . at its highest flood
  
I dashed across unseen,


---

p.4


For there was lightning in my blood,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My own Rosaleen!
  
Oh! there was lightning in my blood,
  
Red lightning lightened through my blood,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
3. All day long in unrest
  
To and fro do I move,
  
The very soul within my breast
  
Is wasted for you, love!
  
The heart . . . in my bosom faints
  
To think of you, my Queen,
  
My life of life, my saint of saints,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My own Rosaleen!
  
To hear your sweet and sad complaints,
  
My life, my love, my saint of saints,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
4. Woe and pain, pain and woe,
  
Are my lot night and noon,
  
To see your bright face clouded so,
  
Like to the mournful moon.
  
But yet . . . will I rear your throne
  
Again in golden sheen;
  
'Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My own Rosaleen!
  
'Tis you shall have the golden throne,
  
'Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
5. Over dews, over sands
  
Will I fly for your weal;


---

p.5


Your holy delicate white hands
  
Shall girdle me with steel.
  
At home . . . in your emerald bowers,
  
From morning's dawn till e'en,
  
You'll pray for me, my flower of flowers,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My fond Rosaleen!
  
You'll think of me through Daylight's hours,
  
My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
6. I could scale the blue air,
  
I could plough the high hills,
  
Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer,
  
To heal your many ills!
  
And one . . . beamy smile for you
  
Would float like light between
  
My toils and me, my own, my true,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My fond Rosaleen!
  
Would give me life and soul anew,
  
A second life, a soul anew,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
7. O! the Erne shall run red
  
With redundance of blood,
  
The earth shall rock beneath our tread,
  
And flames wrap hill and wood,
  
And gun-peal, a slogan cry,
  
Wake many a glen serene,
  
Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
  
My own Rosaleen!
  
The Judgment Hour must first be nigh,
  
Ere you can fade, ere you can die,
  
My Dark Rosaleen!
