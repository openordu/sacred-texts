Robert FitzStephen came to Ireland, as he
had promised Mac Murchadha, with thirty knights, three score esquires, and

supporters. The principal knights who came there with Robert FitzStephen were,
Maurice FitzGerald, Robert de Barry, Meiler FitzHenry, and Hervey de
Montmorency: it was this Hervey who endowed the monastery of Dúin
Bróith. They confirmed their agreement, and unfurling their banners they
proceeded with one accord to attack Wexford, and captured it. After its
capture, Mac Murchadha, as he had promised, handed it over to Robert
FitzStephen and Maurice FitzGerald, together with the county to the east and
the west of it. He went from thence to Osraighe, where he inflicted slaughter
and took hostages from Mac Giolla Phádraig as an earnest of submission

events reached Ruaidhrí Ó Conchobhair, who was titled King of
Ireland at that time. He assembled those of the forces of Ireland who were his

Fearna, and they made peace: Diarmaid Mac Murchadha was to receive Ó
Conchobhair's daughter as wife, and Mac Murchadha was to send back the knights,
and not to bring any more foreigners to Ireland, nor to support them there. He
gave up his own halidoms and his son to Ó Conchobhair in token of his
fulfilment of that agreement.


#### MCB1167.8


A short time after this, Mac Murchadha sent letters to England for Richard,
Earl of Striguil. The Earl sent Raymond le Gros FitzGerald with ten knights
