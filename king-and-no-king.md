p.94


1. 'WOULD it were anything but merely voice!'
  
The No King cried who after that was King,
  
Because he had not heard of anything
  
That balanced with a word is more than noise;
  
Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
  
Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
  
Though he'd but cannon—Whereas we that had thought
  
To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
  
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
  
In momentary anger long ago;

p.95


And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
  
That in the blinding light beyond the grave
  
We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?
  
The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,
  
The habitual content of each with each
  
When neither soul nor body has been crossed.
