### The Mountain Tomb: Author: William Butler Yeats




---

p.64


1. POUR wine and dance if Manhood still have pride,
  
Bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;
  
The cataract smokes upon the mountain side,
  
Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.
2. Pull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet
  
That there be no foot silent in the room
  
Nor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;
  
Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.
3. In vain, in vain; the cataract still cries


---

p.65


The everlasting taper lights the gloom;
  
All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes
  
Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.
