### FOREWORD


America's loss was to be Ireland's gain. For if Michael

Collins had taken his brother Pat's advice, the Republic of Ireland

might not exist today. Watching the storm clouds of World War I gather

over Europe, Pat had written to Michael from Chicago urging his young

brother to leave his job in a London financial institution and come to

join him in America. Had they teamed up, one is tempted to speculate

that one of the all-time great Pat-and-Mike success stories might have

resulted. As it was, Pat became a captain of police in Chicago and

Michael went on to destroy the Irish police force, the armed Royal

Irish Constabulary (R.I.C.). In doing so he laid the foundations for

today's unarmed Irish police, the Garda Síochána or

Civic Guard.


In the early stages of World War I, the then twenty-six

year-old Collins agonised over Pat's letters inviting him to America.

He took long lonely walks through London's dockland, seeing the ships

leave for the New World, wondering should he go himself. War meant

conscription would come, bringing with it an

 unthinkable choice: to become a conscientious objector,

a course repugnant to his warrior soul, or to don a British uniform

and fight for the Crown.


Collins solved the problem in his own inimitable way. He

put on an Irish uniform and went to fight for Ireland, in the 1916

Easter Rebellion in Dublin. He was captured and sent to Frongoch

Internment Camp in Wales, the Republican University as it was known.

It was here, in prison, that he began to think out a new philosophy of

warfare and to re-organise the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the

I.R.B., which later spearheaded the fight for Irish independence and

led to the creation of modern Ireland. He was also the founder of

modern urban guerilla warfare, the first freedom fighter, or urban

terrorist. Mao Tse tSung studied his methods. And Yatzik Shamir, the

former Prime Minister of Israel, was so impressed with Collins that

not alone did he study him, he took the codename Micail for his Irgun unit during the Israeli war of

independence against the British.


Before considering his career and writings, I must briefly

diverge to look at Collins' origins and examine what led him to a

London counting house in the first place. He was born, the youngest of

eight children, on a ninety-acre farm, a good holding for Catholics of

the time, near Clonakilty in West Cork in 1890, to a remarkable set of

parents. His father was nearly forty years older than his mother,

Marianne, and was in his seventy-sixth year when Michael arrived.

Neither parent had much formal education but they both knew French,

Latin, Greek, Irish and English. And, apart from being an expert

farmer and veterinarian,


---

p.ix




 Michael senior was also noted for his knowledge of

astronomy, mathematics, and for his skill as a builder. The Collins,

or the O'Coileain as they were known in Irish, were once a very

considerable Munster clan. And the family, both in Michael Collins'

day and in our own, is recognised as being unusually intelligent and

well-doing.


However Michael senior died when young Michael was six,

leaving Marianne to run the farm and look after the eight children.

One by one, all the children were forced to emigrate, until only

Johnny, who ran the farm after Marianne contracted cancer, and

Michael, who was then fourteen, were left at home.


There was at the time a tradition of recruiting for the

British postal service in the Clonakilty area. When a baby boy was

born, the neighbours' first comment on looking into the pram was

‘musha 'tis the fine sorter he'll make’. Collins attended a class

in Clonakilty which prepared pupils for the post office exams, and, at

the age of sixteen, crossed over to London to live with his sister

Hannie and take up work as a boy clerk in Kensington Post Office

Savings Bank.


Collins became very active in the Irish-Ireland life of

London, joining the Gaelic League to learn Irish, and the Gaelic

Athletic Association to play Gaelic football and hurling, one of the

most skilful and dangerous stick games in the world. He was a natural

athlete, a particularly fine hurler, with a cloud-burst temperament

that meant he either initiated or was drawn to any fights that broke

out on the field. His deep belief in these associations and commitment

to Gaelic culture are clear in his essay Freedom Within 


---

p.x


 Grasp, For Ourselves to Achieve It. He

found time too to continue his studies and to become a regular theatre

goer, a particular fan of George Bernard Shaw. He was an omnivorous

reader, mopping up anything he could find in the way of Irish

nationalist literature and a variety of other authors including

Conrad, Arnold Bennet, Chesterton, Hardy, Meredith, Swinburne as well

as Irish literary figures such as Wilde, Yeats, Pádraic Colum

and James Stephens.


And now we come to the point where Collins' shadow begins

to fall across contemporary Ireland. In or around 1914 he was sworn

into the oath-bound secret society, the Irish Republican Brotherhood,

by a fellow Corkman, Sam Maguire. The then political situation was

that Ireland had lost its parliament under the Act of Union of 1800.

Its culture, industry and population had suffered grievously as a

result, the Great Famine is only one of the many ills on which we need

not dwell here. But in 1914 Ireland seemed to be in a fair way of

getting its own government back again. At Westminster the Irish

Parliamentary Party, the constitutionalist wing of Irish nationalist

self-assertion, had brought Home Rule to the Statute Book under the

leadership of John Redmond. Ireland seemed to be on the verge of

achieving its own parliament. But there was opposition.


In the north of the country, the Protestants of

North-Eastern Ulster clung to their Scottish ancestry and British

links. They wanted to remain in union with Westminster just exactly as

do the unionists of today. More importantly, like today's unionists,

they were backed to the point, and some would say beyond


---

p.xi




 the point, of treason in this attitude by the British

Conservative Party. The Tories dealt a death blow to Home Rule, which

had been passed by a democratically elected majority in the House of

Commons, by two major acts of defiance of Parliament. One was their

sponsorship of the illegal gun running at Larne which put teeth into

the Protestants' resolution to resist. The second was their even more

efficacious sponsorship of a move within the British Army to refuse to

proceed against their rebellious co-religionists, known as the Curragh

mutiny.


The Conservatives were not acting out of affection for the

Ulster Protestants. But they used the Orangemen, as they were known

after the Orange society to which so many of them belonged, as a

weapon in domestic British politics to undermine the Liberal

Government led by Prime Minister Asquith which had been driven to

sponsor Home Rule through dependence on Irish Party support for its

majority. The tactic, known as playing the Orange Card, was invented

by Randolph Churchill, Winston's father. He coined the phrase

‘Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right’. As his grandson,

also called Randolph, wrote sixty years later: ‘that pithy phrase

explains why Ulster is part of the United Kingdom today’.


The I.R.B., or Fenian movement, distrusted British politics

and politicians as a matter of dogma. The Fenians did not accept that

Britain would ever confer Home Rule, or any form of independence on

Ireland unless it were forced to, not by parliamentary methods, but by

physical force. For those with a taste for symbolism I may digress to

remark that


---

p.xii




 the constitutionalist John Redmond is now seldom heard of

in Ireland. Today Ireland's premier sporting trophy is the Sam Maguire

Cup which is played for each year in the All-Ireland Football Final at

Croke Park. And Northern Ireland is still something of a political

football.


However to revert to Michael Collins. In his every-day

working life Collins sought to broaden his range of experience by

moving from the Post Office to a firm of stockbrokers, Horne and Co,

from there to a clerkship in the Board of Trade and finally, perhaps

because of his brother Pat's urgings, he moved, to gain a flavour of

American business life, to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York's

London Office where war found him.


He found his own war in Dublin in Easter 1916. It was a

rebellion that should not have been allowed to happen. Had Home Rule

for all Ireland not been aborted by the strength of the

unionist/conservative alliance, there would have been no subsequent

Anglo-Irish war, no civil war, no Partition and no I.R.A., or Northern

Ireland problem today. But that searing week of flame and folly during

Easter 1916 claimed the lives of some of the people Collins most

admired: Tom Clarke, James Connolly, Sean Hurley, Seán

MacDiarmada, Joseph Plunkett. To him their deaths were a debt owed, a

charge against freedom, which England would repay. However, he would

not present his bill for retribution by means of conventional

warfare.


He still believed in fighting. In the parliamentary game as

played at Westminster the rules were so arranged that the outnumbered

Irish nationalists


---

p.xiii




 always lost. Collins now understood also that static

warfare, i.e. seizing a stronghold, be it a building such as Dublin's

General Post Office in which he fought during the rebellion, or a

mountain top, and then slugging it out with rifles and shot guns

against an adversary who possessed heavy artillery, would continue to

provide the Irish with heroes and martyrs—and the British with

victories.


Instead Collins evolved a new concept of guerilla warfare

based not on the capture of the enemy's bricks and mortar, but of its

information. Traditionally, Dublin Castle, the seat of British

administration in Ireland, had used a network of spies and informers

to infiltrate and then snuff out movements directed at securing Irish

independence. Collins perfected a system of spying on the spies. Every

important branch of the Castle system, be it banking, policing, the

railways, the postal service, was infiltrated by his agents. They were

not highly trained, C.I.A.-style operatives, but ordinary men and

women, people whom nobody had ever taken notice of before. Collins

gave them a belief in themselves, a courage they did not know they

possessed, and they in return gave him a complete picture of how their

masters operated.


A secretary in Military Intelligence saw to it that Collins

had a copy of the Colonel's orders to the Captain before the officer

received the originals. A railway porter carried dispatches, the

docker smuggled in revolvers, the detective told him who the informers

were—and the Squad used the revolvers to deal with them. The

Squad was his particular brainchild. For the first time in her history

the Irish had a team of


---

p.xiv




 assassins trained to eliminate informers. I once handled

the weapons used by the Squad, parabellums, '45s, Colt revolvers, and

it was quite a chilling moment to be told: ‘Each of those revolvers

killed at least six men’. I later realised of course that, in the

scale of modern warfare, the totals were tiny. Collins was careful

about wasting human life. He struck selectively, to achieve the

maximum political and psychological advantage. As he said himself,

‘England could always replace a detective. But the man can not step

into the dead man's shoes—and his knowledge’. He thus

demoralised the hitherto invincible Royal Irish Constabulary, the

armed police force which operated from fortified barracks and held

Ireland for the Crown.


Action was not confined to Dublin. Generalised warfare

broke out all over the country as the British introduced new men and

new methods in a vain effort to counter the guerilla tactics of

Collins' Active Service Units and the Flying Columns of Volunteers,

which lived on the run, eating and sleeping where they could.


Held back from making a full scale use of their Army by the

force of world opinion, largely Irish-American opinion, the British

tried to fight a police war carried on by

hastily formed forces of ex-service men and officers troubled by

little discipline and less conscience. The Black and Tans and the

Auxiliaries wrote new chapters of horror in the bloodstained story of

the Anglo-Irish relationship. Reprisals for the activities of Collins

and his colleagues included the burning of homes and creameries,

random murder


---

p.xv




 and the widespread use of torture. Through it all Collins

lived a ‘life on the bicycle’. The most wanted man in Europe, he

smiled his way through a hundred hold-ups never wearing a disguise,

never missing an appointment, never certain where he would spend the

night.


One of his central ideas was derived from G.K. Chesterton's

 The Man Who Was Thursday. He was given the book by

Joseph Plunkett, his immediate superior in 1916. Plunkett, who was

dying of tuberculosis, took part in the fighting and was married in

his cell, ten minutes before facing a firing squad. Obviously any

relic of such a figure would be prized by his lieutenant. And Collins

prized in particular the advice of the Chief Anarchist in the

Chesterton book: ‘if you don't seem to be hiding nobody hunts you

out’. Accordingly, Collins never seemed to be hiding. He always

wore good suits, neatly pressed. And time after time, this young

businessman was passed through police cordons unsearched, with his

pockets stuffed with incriminating documents. It seems to be an iron

law with policemen both in Collins' time and ours, that terrorists are

not expected to wear pin-striped suits and clean collars and ties.


He had a network of safe houses and secret rooms where he

transacted business. One room I examined was reached by pulling a

lever which caused the bottom half of a kitchen dresser to swing

upwards on hinges. Collins used to work in the house, until it was

raided and then slip into the secret room and work away until the

soldiers surrounding the house moved out of the garden. None of them

ever realised that


---

p.xvi


 there was an unaccounted for window in the back wall of the house.


In addition to his campaign of warfare Collins ran a

national loan which was banned by the British so that its

advertisement or sale became illegal. Yet the loan was fully

subscribed and every subscriber got a receipt. He was President of the

omnipresent I.R.B. which regarded him as the real President of the

Irish Republic, and Minister for Finance in the Sinn

Féin Cabinet. In addition, he was Director of Intelligence

of the Irish Republican Army (I.R.A.). Any one of those jobs would

have consumed the energy of an ordinary man, but Collins combined them

all efficiently and effectively.


He combined a mind like a laser beam with a hawk-like eye

for detail. Nothing escaped his attention. Everything attracted his

interest. Shaw's latest play, the way the Swiss organised a Citizen

Army, Benjamin Franklin's proposals for dealing with loyalists, or the

latest edition of Popular Mechanics. An article in this

journal in November of 1920 led to the first use in warfare of the

Thomson gun. Collins saw the article on the recently invented weapon

and had enquiries made about ‘this splendid thing’
> [Footnote: Described by Sean Cronin, The McGarrity Papers,
> 
> Anvil Books, Tralee, Co. Kerry, 1978, p. 98. ]
> 
> 

, which led to the

Irish-American leader Joseph McGarrity of Philadelphia buying five

hundred of the weapons. Two Irish-American ex-officers were sent to

Ireland to train the I.R.A. in the use of the weapons. Only a handful

got through the American customs, but these were duly used in a number

of Dublin ambushes.


Collins was tough and abrasive with his male, and sometimes

female, colleagues. But he was gentle and


---

p.xvii




 playful with children and old people. Throughout the

eighteen months that Eamon de Valera was in America, on a propaganda

and fund-raising mission, which lasted most of the Anglo-Irish war,

Collins risked his life to call each week to his absent chief's

family, bringing them money and companionship.


Eventually the war effort that Collins had spear-headed

drove the British to a conference table and a settlement as

foreseeable as it was unpalatable to many Irishmen and women, a

partitioned Irish Free State that would owe allegiance to the Crown.

It was a deal which had been foreshadowed to de Valera in four days of

talks between himself and Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, in

London during July 1921. But de Valera did not want to be the man who

faced up to the implications of that deal. Instead he repaid the

kindness Collins had shown his family in Machiavellian fashion. He

stayed away himself from the opprobrious negotiations but manipulated

Collins into going to London as part of the delegation which signed

the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 6th, 1921, the constitutional

foundation document of modern Ireland. Collins, who took the leading

part in the Treaty's negotiation, faced one of the most powerful

British delegations ever assembled. Winston Churchill only ranked

fourth on the team which was led by Lloyd George and included the Lord

Chancellor, Lord Birkenhead and the leader of the Conservative Party

Austen Chamberlain. Subsequently Collins became Chairman of the

Executive Council (in effect the Government) of the Irish Free State

which emerged, and, later, Commander-in-Chief of the Army.




---

p.xviii


The Treaty did not yield the Republic he had hoped for but

it provided what Collins prophetically termed a ‘stepping stone’

to today's Irish Republic. All the other stepping stones to the

tragedy of today's Northern Ireland situation were part of that

negotiation too. In a very real sense Collins' premature death was

caused by the forces which still rage about the North-Eastern corner

of the land and people he fought for. The story of his life explains

present day news from Belfast. He was forced into an impossible,

janus-faced policy. On the one hand, as head of the infant Provisional

Government of Southern Ireland, he argued fiercely for the Treaty's

potential for democracy and freedom as we can read in many of his

articles and speeches. He engaged in civil war to defend it against de

Valera and his former comrades in the I.R.A.


On the other hand, the plight of the Catholics in Northern

Ireland, subject to pogrom and prejudice, drove him to arm secretly

the I.R.A. in the North. He did everything in his power to destabilise

the northern state. He organised burnings, raids, kidnappings; and

once, when some of his followers faced execution, he sent two former

members of the Squad over to England to shoot the British executioners

who were detailed to hang them. At the last moment the I.R.A. men were

reprieved. So were the hangmen.


One of the great questions of Irish history is: If Collins

had lived longer would he have brought fire or prosperity to his

country? Or would he have died of drink or disillusionment at the

effects of the civil war which broke out over the terms of the Treaty?

Certainly he had more business acumen and vision than


---

p.xix




 any of his contemporaries. He foresaw a role for Ireland

in Europe long before the E.U. was ever heard of. He preaches in one

essay that Ireland should study the lessons of German scientific

advancement, Danish agriculture, and bring them back home to develop a

distinctive Irish economy and culture of its own. He loved the Irish

language, but not merely as a medium of expression. As we learn in

 Distinctive Culture, Ancient Irish Civilization he saw

in the language a method of thinking and ultimately of acting, more

suited to Ireland than the Anglo-Saxon inheritance. He believed in

personal initiative, writing in Building Up Ireland, Resources

To Be Developed


‘‘Millionaires can spend their surplus wealth

bestowing libraries broadcast upon the world. But who will say that

the benefits accruing could be compared with those arising from a

condition of things in which the people themselves everywhere, in the

city, town, and village were prosperous enough to buy their own books

and to put together their own local libraries in which they could take

a personal interest and acquire knowledge in proportion to that

interest.’’


Tragically we will never know how this

marvellous man might have developed. For as the German poet Heine once

remarked, the Irish always pull down a noble stag. Our Irish Siegfried

kept his appointment in Samarra a couple of months short of his

thirty-second birthday in a remote Cork valley known in Irish as

Beál na mBláth, the Mouth of Flowers. He died during


---

p.xx


 the Civil War not far from where he was born, in an ambush

laid by a former comrade in arms, a man who during the Anglo-Irish War

had undergone sadistic tortures at the hands of British Intelligence

Officers rather than betray his boyhood friend, Michael Collins.

Collins' career is a paradigm of the tragedy of modern Ireland, the

suffering, the waste of talent, the hope, the bedevilling effects of

history and nomenclature whereby one man's terrorist is another man's

freedom fighter. Like Prometheus, Collins stole fire. Like Prometheus

he paid for his feat and much of what he set about doing remains

undone. But his name burns brightly wherever the Irish meet. Michael

Collins was the man who made modern Ireland

possible.

### Publisher's Note to the Original Edition


The following Notes drafted by General Collins early

in August and apparently intended for public utterance, probably to An

Dáil, were without correction by him. Obviously no one can now

say what the changing circumstances might have caused him to alter or

add.


The Notes are now printed as an introduction to the

articles written by General Collins.

Notes by General Michael Collins


August, 1922
-----------------------------------------------


After a national struggle sustained through many

centuries, we have today in Ireland a native Government deriving its

authority solely from the Irish people, and acknowledged by England

and the other nations of the world.


Through those centuries—through hopes and through

disappointments—the Irish people have struggled to get rid of a

foreign Power which was preventing them from exercising their simple

right to live and to govern themselves as they pleased—which

tried to destroy our nationality, our institutions, which tried to

abolish our customs and blot out our civilization,—all that made

us Irish, all that united us as a nation.


But Irish nationality survived. It did not perish when

native government was destroyed, and a foreign military despotism was

set up. And for this reason, that it was not made by the old native

government and it could not be destroyed by the foreign usurping

government. It was the national spirit which created the old native

government, and not the native government which created the national

spirit. And nothing that the


---

p.4




 foreign government could do could destroy the national

spirit.


But though it survived, the soul of the nation drooped

and weakened. Without the protection of a native government we were

exposed to the poison of foreign ways. The national character was

infected and the life of the nation was endangered. We had armed

risings and political agitation. We were not strong enough to put out

the foreign Power until the national consciousness was fully re-

awakened. This was why the Gaelic Movement and Sinn Féin were

necessary for our last successful effort. Success came with the

inspiration which the new national movement gave to our military and

political effort. The Gaelic spirit working through the Dáil

and the Army was irresistible.


In this light we must look at the present situation.


The new spirit of self-reliance and our splendid unity,

and an international situation which we were able to use to our

advantage, enabled our generation to make the greatest and most

successful national effort in our history.


The right of Ireland as a nation under arms to decide its

own destiny was acknowledged. We were invited to a Peace Conference.

With the authority of Ireland's elected representatives negotiations

were entered into between the two belligerent nations in order to find

a basis of peace.


During the war we had gathered strength by the justice of

our cause, and by the way in which we had carried on the struggle. We

had organised our own government, and had made the most of our

military


---

p.5




 resources. The united nation showed not only endurance and

courage but a humanity which was in marked contrast with the conduct

of the enemy. All this gave us a moral strength in the negotiations of

which we took full advantage.


But in any sane view our military resources were terribly

slender in the face of those of the British Empire which had just

emerged victorious from the world war. It was obvious what would have

been involved in a renewal of armed conflict on a scale which we had

never met before. And it was obvious what we should have lost in

strength if the support of the world which had hitherto been on our

side had been alienated, if Ireland had rejected terms which most

nations would have regarded as terms we could honourably accept.


We had not an easy task.


We were faced with a critical military situation over

against an enemy of infinitely greater potential strength. We had to

face the pride and prejudice of a powerful nation which had claimed

for centuries to hold Ireland as a province. We had to face all the

traditions, and political experience, and strength of the British

nation. And on our flank we had a section of our own people who had

identified their outlook and interests with those of Britain.


It may be claimed that we did not fail in our task. We

got the substance of freedom, as has already been made real before our

eyes by the withdrawal of the British power.


And the people approved. And they were anxious to use the

freedom secured. *The national instinct was 


---

p.6


 sound*—that the essence of our

struggle was *to secure freedom to order our own

life*, without attaching undue importance to the formulas under

which that freedom would be expressed. The people knew that our

government could and would be moulded by the nation itself according

to its needs. The nation would make the government, not the government

the nation.


But on the return of Ireland's representatives from

London, Mr. de Valera, who was then leader of the nation, condemned

the Treaty in a public statement, while supporting similar proposals

for peace which he described as differing ‘only by a shadow’.


But he, and all the Deputies, joined in discussing and

voting on the Treaty, and after full discussion and expressions of

opinion from all parts of the country, the Treaty was approved.


And Mr. de Valera declared that there was a

constitutional way of solving our differences. He expressed his

readiness to accept the decision of the people. He resigned office,

and a Provisional Government was formed to act with Dáil Éireann.


Two duties faced that Government:

1. To take over the Executive from the English,

and to maintain public order during the transition from foreign to

native government; and
2. To give shape in a constitution to the

freedom secured.



If the Government had been allowed to carry out these

duties no difficulty would have arisen with


---

p.7




 England, who carried out her part by evacuating her army

and her administration. No trouble would have arisen among our own

people. And the general trend of development, and the undoubted

advantages of unity, would have brought the North-East quietly into

union with the rest of the country, as soon as a stable national

government had been established into which they could have come with

confidence.


Mr. de Valera, and those who supported him in the Dáil, were asked to take part in the interim

government, without prejudice to their principles, and their right to

oppose the ratification of the Treaty at the elections.


They were asked to help in keeping an orderly united

nation with the greatest possible strength over against England,

exercising the greatest possible peaceful pressure towards the union

of all Ireland, and with the greatest amount of credit for us in the

eyes of the world, and with the greatest advantage to the nation

itself in having a strong united government to start the departments

of State, and to deal with the urgent problems of housing, land,

hunger, and unemployment.


They did not find it possible to accept this offer of

patriotic service.


Another offer was then made.


If they would not join in the work of transition, would

they not co-operate in preserving order to allow that transition

peacefully to take place? Would they not co-operate in keeping the

army united, free from political bias, so as to preserve its strength

for the proper purpose of defending the country in the exercise of its

rights?




---

p.8


This also was refused.


It must be remembered that the country was emerging from

a revolutionary struggle. And, as was to be expected, some of our

people were in a state of excitement, and it was obviously the duty of

all leaders to direct the thoughts of the people away from violence

and into the steady channels of peace and obedience to authority. No

one could have been blind to the course things were bound to take if

this duty were neglected.


It was neglected, and events took their course.


Our ideal of nationality was distorted in hair-splitting

over the meaning of sovereignty and other

foreign words, under advice from minds dominated by English ideas of

nationality; and, led away, some soon got out of control and betook

themselves to the very methods we had learned to detest in the English

and had united to drive out of the country.


By the time the �rd Fheis

met the drift had become apparent. And the feeling in favour of

keeping the national forces united was so strong that a belated

agreement was arrived at. In return for a postponement of the

elections, the Anti- Treaty Party pledged themselves to allow the work

of the Provisional Government to proceed.


What came of that pledge?


Attempts to stampede meetings by revolver shootings, to

wreck trains, the suppression of free speech, of the liberty of the

Press, terrorisation and sabotage of a kind that we were familiar with

a year ago. And with what object; With the sole object of preventing

the people from expressing their will, and of making the government of

Ireland by the representatives of


---

p.9




 the people as impossible as the English Government was made

impossible by the united forces a year ago.


The policy of the Anti-Treaty Party had now become

clear—to prevent the people's will from being carried out

because it differed from their own, to create trouble in order to

break up the only possible national government, and to destroy the

Treaty with utter recklessness as to the consequences.


A section of the army, in an attempt at a military

despotism, seized public buildings, took possession of the Chief

Courts of Law of the Nation, dislocating private and national

business, reinforced the Belfast Boycott which had been discontinued

by the people's government, and commandeered

public and private funds, and the property of the people.


Met by this reckless and wrecking opposition, and yet

unwilling to use force against our own countrymen, we made attempt

after attempt at conciliation.


We appealed to the soldiers to avoid strife, to let the

old feelings of brotherhood and solidarity continue.


We met and made advances over and over again to the

politicians, standing out alone on the one fundamental point on which

we owed an unquestioned duty to the people—that we must maintain

for them the position of freedom they had secured. We could get no

guarantee that we would be allowed to carry out that duty.


The country was face to face with disaster, economic

ruin, and the imminent danger of the loss of the position we had won

by the national effort. If order could not be maintained, if no

National Government was to be allowed to function, a vacuum would be

created, into which the English would be


---

p.10




 necessarily drawn back. To allow that to happen would have

been the greatest betrayal of the Irish people, whose one wish was to

take and to secure and to make use of the freedom which had been

won.


Seeing the trend of events, soldiers from both sides met

to try and reach an understanding, on the basis that the people were

admittedly in favour of the Treaty, that the only legitimate

government could be one based on the people's will and that the

practicable course was to keep the peace, and to make use of the

position we had secured.


Those honourable efforts were defeated by the

politicians. But at the eleventh hour an agreement was reached between

Mr. de Valera and myself for which I have been severely

criticised.


It was said that I gave away too much, that I went too

far to meet them, that I had exceeded my powers in making a pact

which, to some extent, interfered with the people's right to make a

free and full choice at the elections.


It was a last effort on our part to avoid strife, to

prevent the use of force by Irishmen against Irishmen. We refrained

from opposing the Anti-Treaty Party at the elections. We stood aside

from political conflict, so that, so far as we were concerned, our

opponents might retain the full number of seats which they had held in

the previous Dáil. And I undertook, with

the approval of the Government, that they should hold four out of the

nine offices in the new Ministry. They calculated that in this way

they would have the same position in the new Dáil as in the old. But their calculations

were upset by the people themselves, and


---

p.11




 they then dropped all pretence of representing the people,

and turned definitely against them.


The Irregular Forces in the Four Courts continued in

their mutinous attitude. They openly defied the newly expressed will

of the people. On the pretext of enforcing a boycott of Belfast goods,

they raided and looted a Dublin garage, and when the leader of the

raid was arrested by the National Forces, they retaliated by the

seizure of one of the principal officers of the National Army.


Such a challenge left two courses open to the National

Government: either to betray its trust and surrender to the mutineers,

or to fulfil its duty and carry out the work entrusted to it by the

people.


The Government did its duty. Having given them one last

opportunity to accept the situation, to obey the people's will, when

the offer was rejected the Government took the necessary measures to

protect the rights and property of the people and to disperse the

armed bands which had outlawed themselves and were preying upon the

nation.


Unbelievers had said that there was not, and had never

been, an Irish Nation capable of harmonious, orderly development. That

it was not the foreign invader but the character of the Irish

themselves which throughout history had made of our country a scene of

strife.


We knew this to be a libel. Our historians had shown our

nationality as existing from legendary ages, and through centuries of

foreign oppression.


What made Ireland a nation was a common way of life,

which no military force, no political change could


---

 destroy. Our strength lay in a common ideal of how a

people should live, bound together by mutual ties, and by a devotion

to Ireland which shrank from no individual sacrifice. This

consciousness of unity carried us to success in our last great

struggle.


In that spirit we fought and won. The old fighting spirit

was as strong as ever, but it had gained a fresh strength in

discipline in our generation. Every county sent its boys whose

unrecorded deeds were done in the spirit of Cuchulain at the Ford.


But the fight was not for one section of the nation

against another, but for Ireland against the foreign oppressor. We

fought for that for which alone fighting is really justified—for

national freedom, for the right of the whole people to live as a

nation.


And we fought in a way we had never fought before, and

Ireland won a victory she had never won before.


The foreign Power was withdrawn. The civil administration

passed into the hands of the elected representatives of the people.

The fight with the English enemy was ended. The function of our armed

forces was changed. Their duty now was to preserve the freedom

won—to enable the people to use it, to realise that for which

they had fought—a free, prosperous, self-governing Gaelic

Ireland.


Differences as to political ideals such as remained or

might develop amongst us—these were not a matter for the army,

these were not a matter for force, for violence.


Under the democratic system which was being established

by the representatives of the people—the freest and most

democratic system yet devised—the


---

p.13




 rights of every minority were secured, and the fullest

opportunity was open for every section of opinion to express and

advocate its views by appeal to reason and patriotic sentiment.


In these circumstances, the only way in which individual

views could be rightly put forward by patriotic Irishmen was by

peaceful argument and appeal. The time had come when the best policy

for Ireland could be promoted in ways which would keep the nation

united—strong against the outside world, and settling its own

differences peacefully at home.


To allow such a situation to develop successfully

required only common sense and patriotism in the political leaders. No

one denied that the new Government had the support of the people.


Of all forms of government a democracy allows the

greatest freedom—the greatest possibilities for the good of all.

But such a government, like all governments, must be recognised and

obeyed.


The first duty of the new Government was to maintain

public order, security of life, personal liberty, and property.


The duty of the leaders was to secure free discussion of

public policy, and to get all parties to recognise that, while they

differed, they were fellow-citizens of one free State. It should have

been the political glory of Ireland to show that our differences of

opinion could express themselves so as to promote, and not to destroy,

the national life.


The army had to recognise that they were the servants and

not the masters of the people—that their function was not to

impose their will on the people but to secure to the people


---

p.14




 the right to express their own will and to order their

lives accordingly.


All this might indeed appear obvious to all patriotic

persons.


But with the removal of the pressure of the English

enemy, the spirit of order, and unity, and devotion to Ireland as a

whole was suddenly weakened in some directions. The readiness to fight

remained after the occasion for fighting was gone. Some lost grasp of

the ideal for which they had fought and magnified personal differences

into a conflict of principles.


The road was clear for us to march forward, peaceful and

united, to achieve our goal and the revival of our Gaelic

civilization. The peace and order necessary for that progress was

rudely broken. The united forward movement was held up by an outbreak

of anarchic violence.


The nation which had kept the old heroic temper, but had

learnt to govern it so that violence should be directed against the

national enemy, and its differences should be matters of friendly

rivalry, found itself faced with a small minority determined to break

up the national unity and to destroy the government in which the

nation had just shown its confidence.


They claimed to be fighting for the nation. That might be

possible if there were any enemies of the nation opposing them. There

are not. Resolved to fight, they are fighting, not against an enemy,

but against their own nation. Blind to facts, and false to ideals,

they are making war on the Irish people.


To conceal this truth they claim to be opposing the

National Government which they declare to be a


---

p.15




 usurpation. In view of the elections this is absurd

enough. No one can deny that the present Government rests on the will

of the people, the sole authority for any government. And what was the

usurpation they complained of? Simply that the Government refused to

allow authority to be wrested from it by an armed minority. If it is

not right for a National Government to keep public order, to prevent

murder, arson, and brigandage, what are the duties of a

government?


But it is not the fact that they have directed their

fight against the National Government and the National Army. It was

against the Irish people themselves that they directed their

operations.


The anti-national character of their campaign became

clear when we saw them pursuing exactly the same course as the English

Black and Tans. They robbed and destroyed, not merely for the sake of

loot, and from a criminal instinct to destroy (though in any candid

view of their operations these elements must be seen to have been

present) but on a plan, and for a definite purpose. Just as the

English claimed that they were directing their attack against a

‘murder gang’, so the irregulars claim that they are making war

on a ‘usurping’ government.


But, in reality, the operations and the motives in both

cases were, and are, something quite different—namely, the

persecution and terrorism of the unarmed population, and the attempt

by economic destruction, famine, and violence, to ‘make an

appropriate hell’ in Ireland, in the hope of breaking up the

organised National Government and undermining the loyalty of the

people.




---

p.16


And of what is it all the inevitable outcome? Of the

course to which the unthinking enthusiasm of some was directed when

they were told repeatedly that it might be necessary to turn their

arms against their brothers and to wade through Irish blood.


But the true nature of the whole movement has now

demonstrated itself so that no one can doubt it. A tree is known by

its fruits—we have seen the fruits. The Irish people will be

confirmed in its conviction that those fruits are deadly. They will

have no sympathy with anarchy and violence.


The Irish people know that true Irish nationality does

not express itself in these ways. They know it is the Government, and

not those who call themselves Republicans, who are upholding the

national ideal.


The tactics of disruption and disorder were anti-national

in paralysing the energies which were needed for building up the new

Ireland.


Worse still, their violence and the passions it aroused

have broken up the united concentration on the revival of our language

and of our Irish life.


Worst of all, their action has been a crime against the

nation in this—that the anarchy and ruin they were bringing

about was undermining the confidence of the nation in itself. So far

as it succeeded it was proving that our enemies were right, that we

were incapable of self-government. When left to ourselves in freedom

we could show nothing of the native civilization we had claimed as our

own.


The Black and Tans with all their foreign brutality were

unable to make of Ireland ‘an appropriate hell’. The irregulars

brought their country to the brink of a


---

p.17




 real hell, the black pit in which our country's name and

credit would have sunk, in which our existence as a distinct nation,

*our belief in ourselves as a nation* might have

perished for ever. If they had succeeded in destroying the National

Government, and reducing the country to anarchy, the greatest evil

would have been, not that the English would have come back, that would

indeed have been terrible enough, *but that they

would have been welcomed back, that they would have come not as

enemies, but as the only protectors who could bring order and

peace*.


For hundreds of years we had preserved our national

hopes. We were on the point of achieving them, but when the real test

came the national consciousness lapsed in the minds of some whom the

nation had trusted. The wrong done was not merely to the material

prospects of the nation *but to its soul*.


The calamity was unnecessary. There lies the wrong to the

nation. A simple acceptance of the people's will! That was all that

was asked of them. What principle could such an acceptance have

violated?


All further measures necessary will be taken to maintain

peace and order.


We have to face realities.


There is no British Government any longer in Ireland. It

is gone. It is no longer the enemy. We have now a native government,

constitutionally elected, and it is the duty of every Irish man and

woman to obey it. Anyone who fails to obey it is an enemy of the

people and must expect to be treated as such.


We have to learn that attitudes and actions which were

justifiable when directed against an alien


---

p.18




 administration, holding its position by force, are wholly

unjustifiable against a native government which exists only to carry

out the people's will, and which can be changed the moment it ceases

to do so.


We have to learn that freedom imposes

responsibilities.


This parliament is now the controlling body. With the

unification of the administration it will be clothed with full

authority. Through the parliament the people have the right, and the

power, to get the constitution, the legislation, and the economic and

educational arrangements they desire. The courts of law, which are now

our own courts, will be reorganised to make them national in

character, and the people will be able to go to them with confidence

of receiving justice.


That being so, the Government believes it will have the

whole force of public opinion behind it in dealing sternly with all

unlawful acts of every kind, no matter under what name of political or

patriotic, or any other policy that may be carried out.


The National Army, and the new Irish Police Force, acting

in obedience to the Administration, will defend the freedom and rights

of the Nation, and will put down crime of whatever nature, sectarian,

agrarian or confiscatory.


In the special circumstances I have had to stress the

Government's determination to establish the foundations of the state,

to preserve the very life of the Nation. But a policy of development

is engaging the attention of all departments, and will shortly be made

known.


We have a difficult task before us. We have taken over an

alien and cumbersome administration. We


---

p.19




 have to begin the upbuilding of the nation with foreign

tools. But before we can scrap them we must first forge fresh Gaelic

ones to take their place, and must temper their steel.


But if we will all work together in a mutually helpful

spirit, recognising that we all seek the same end, the good of

Ireland, the difficulties will disappear.


The Irish Nation is the whole people, of every class,

creed, and outlook. We recognise no distinction. It will be our aim to

weld all our people nationally together who have hitherto been divided

in political and social and economic outlook.


Labour will be free to take its rightful place as an

element in the life of the nation. In Ireland more than in any other

country lies the hope of the rational adjustment of the rights and

interests of all sections, and the new government starts with the

resolve that Irish Labour shall be free to play the part which belongs

to it in helping to shape our industrial and commercial future.


The freedom, strength, and greatness of the nation will

be measured by the independence, economic well-being, physical

strength and intellectual greatness of the people.


A new page of Irish history is beginning.


We have a rich and fertile country—a sturdy and

intelligent people. With peace, security and union, no one can foresee

the limits of greatness and well-being to which our country may not

aspire.


But it is not only within our country that we have a new

outlook. Ireland has now a recognised international status. Not only

as an equal nation in association


---

p.20




 with the British nations, but as a member of the wider

group forming the League of Nations. As a member of these groups,

Ireland's representatives will have a voice in international affairs,

and will use that voice to promote harmony and peaceful intercourse

among all friendly nations.


In this way Ireland will be able to play a part in the

new world movement, and to play that part in accordance with the old

Irish tradition of an independent distinctive Irish nation, at

harmony, and in close trading, cultural, and social relations, with

all other friendly nations.


In this sense our outlook is new. But our national aim

remains the same—a free, united Irish nation and united Irish

race all over the world, bent on achieving the common aim of Ireland's

prosperity and good name.


Underlying the change of outlook there is this continuity

of outlook.


For 700 years the united effort has been to get the

English out of Ireland. For this end, peaceful internal development

had to be left neglected, and the various interests which would have

had distinct aims had to sink all diversity and unite in the effort of

resistance, and the ejection of the English power.


This particular united effort is now at an end. But it is

to be followed by a new united effort for the actual achievement of

the common goal. The negative work of expelling the English power is

done. The positive work of building a Gaelic Ireland in the vacuum

left has now to be undertaken.


This requires not merely unity, but diversity in unity.

Each Irish interest, each phase of Irish life,


---

p.21




 industrial, commercial, cultural, social, must find

expression and have a voice in the development of the country, partly

by the government, and partly by co-operation and individual

effort.


But they must express themselves and use their influence,

not in hostility to one another, but in co-operation. And in

furthering their special aims, they must do so in the light of the

common ideal—a united, distinctive Irish nationality.


And there must be, to reach this ideal, and particularly

so at this moment, allegiance to and support of the National

Government, democratically elected. At least to the extent of

assisting it to restore and maintain peace and public order, rights of

life and property according to law, freedom for all individuals,

parties, and creeds, to express themselves lawfully.


This is why we claim that the measures to restore order

which we have taken are not repressive. They are seen to be carrying

the liberative movement to completion, clearing away the débris

in order to lay firm and solid the foundations on which to build the

new Ireland.


Those who are restoring order, not those who tried to

destroy it, are the preservers of Irish nationality. Fidelity to the

real Ireland lies in uniting to build up a real Ireland in conformity

with our ideal, and not in disruption and destruction as a sacrifice

to the false gods of foreign-made political formulas.


The ideal is no good unless it lights our present path.

Otherwise it is but a vain sentiment, or misleading will-o'-the-wisp.

We can all be faithful to what is our national ideal—the Ireland

of poetic tradition,


---

p.22




 and the future Ireland which will one day be—the

best of what our country was, and can be again, and the perfect

freedom in which it alone can be the best.


It is because this ideal is not a fact now, that we must

be faithful to it, and our faithfulness to it consists in making it a

fact so far as we can in ourselves and in our day.


Accepting the freedom which we have here and now is to

recognise facts and is to be faithful to the national ideal as taking

the best practical means to achieve as much as we can of the ideal at

the moment. We grasp the substance of freedom, and are true to Ireland

in using that freedom to make an actual Ireland as near to the ideal

one as possible. We have not got, and cannot get now at the moment,

(certainly cannot get without sacrificing the hope of things more

important and essential for our true ideal)—the political

Republic. If we had got it, we should not necessarily be much further

forward towards our true goal—a Gaelic Ireland.


We must be true to facts if we would achieve anything in

this life. We must be true to our ideal, if we would achieve anything

worthy. The Ireland to which we are true, to which we are devoted and

faithful, is the ideal Ireland, which means there is always something

more to strive for. The true devotion lies not in melodramatic

defiance or self-sacrifice for something falsely said to exist, or for

mere words and formalities, which are empty, and which might be but

the house newly swept and garnished to which seven worse devils

entered in. It is the steady, earnest effort in face of actual

possibilities towards the solid achievement of


---

p.23




 our hopes and visions, the laying of stone upon stone of a

building which is actual and in accordance with the ideal pattern.


In this way, what we can do in our time, being done in

faithfulness to the traditions of the past, and to the vision of the

future, becomes significant and glorified beyond what it is if looked

at as only the day's momentary partial work.


This is where our Irish temperament, tenacity of the

past, its vivid sense of past and future greatness, readiness for

personal sacrifice, belief and pride in our race, can play an unique

part, if it can stand out in its intellectual and moral strength, and

shake off the weaknesses which long generations of subjection and

inaction have imposed upon it.


Let the nation show its true and best character: use its

courage, tenacity, clear swift intellect, its pride in the service of

the national ideal as our reason directs us.

‘Advance and use our liberties’
-------------------------------


In my opinion the Truce of July, 1921, could have been

secured in December, 1920, at the time His Grace Archbishop Clune

endeavoured to mediate, but the opportunity was lost through the too

precipitate action of certain of our public men and public bodies.


The actions taken indicated an over-keen desire for

peace, and although terms of Truce were virtually agreed upon, they

were abandoned because the British leaders thought those actions

indicated weakness, and they consequently decided to insist upon

surrender of our arms. The result was the continuance of the struggle.

British aggression went on unabated and our defence was kept up to the

best of our ability.


I am not aware of any negotiations that preceded the

Truce of July. I do know there was much visiting by well-meaning, but

unauthorised persons. So far, however, as my knowledge goes, these did

not have any effect on the communication from Mr. Lloyd George to

President de Valera which opened


---

p.26




 up the period of correspondence between the two

Governments and the subsequent negotiations in London. If there were

any official conversations prior to the Lloyd George Letter, they took

place entirely without my knowledge.


It has been variously stated that the Treaty was signed

under duress.


I did not sign the Treaty under duress, except in the

sense that the position as between Ireland and England, historically,

and because of superior forces on the part of England, has always been

one of duress.


The element of duress was present when we agreed to the

Truce, because our simple right would have been to beat the English

out of Ireland. There was an element of duress in going to London to

negotiate. But there was not, and could not have been, any personal

duress.


The threat of ‘immediate and terrible war’ did not

matter overmuch to me. The position appeared to be then exactly as it

appears now. The British would not, I think, have declared terrible

and immediate war upon us.


They had three courses of action open to them. First, to

dissolve the parliaments and put their proposals before the country;

second, to resume the war by courting openly and covertly breakages of

the Truce (these breakages of the Truce might easily have come from

either side); thirdly, to blockade Ireland, and at the same time

encourage spasmodic internal conflict.


The first course of action seemed to me to be the most

likely, and, as a result of a political win on our


---

p.27




 side either No. 2 or No. 3 would have been very easily

managed by the British. A political reverse would have been more

damaging to us than either 2 or 3.


The threat of immediate and terrible war was probably

bluff. The immediate tactics would surely have been to put the offer

of July 20, which the British considered a very good offer, before the

country, and, if rejected, they would have very little difficulty in

carrying their own people into a war against Ireland.


Another thing I believe is that on resumption of

hostilities the British would have been anxious to fight with us on

the basis of belligerent rights. In such circumstances, I doubt if we

would have been able to carry on a conflict with the success which had

previously attended our efforts. I scarcely think that our resources

would have been equal to bearing belligerent rights and

responsibilities.


I am not impressed by the talk of duress, nor by threats

of a declaration of immediate and terrible war. Britain has not made a

declaration of war upon Egypt, neither has she made a declaration of

war upon India. But is the conflict less terrible because of the

absence of such declaration?


We must not be misled by words and phrases.

Unquestionably the alternative to the Treaty, sooner or later, was

war, and if the Irish Nation had accepted that, I should have gladly

accepted it. The opponents of the Treaty have declared over and over

again that the alternative to the Treaty was not war.


In my judgement, this was misleading the Irish Nation.

The decision of the Irish Nation should not be given on a false basis.

That was, and is, my own


---

p.28




 attitude, and if indeed, it be true, as the antagonists of

the Treaty say, that the alternative to the Treaty was not war, where,

then, is the heroism? Where, then, is the necessity for the future

sacrifices that have been talked of so freely?


To me it would have been a criminal act to refuse to

allow the Irish Nation to give its opinion as to whether it would

accept this settlement or resume hostilities. That, I maintain, is a

democratic stand. It has always been the stand of public

representatives who are alive to their responsibilities.


The Irish struggle has always been for freedom—

freedom from English occupation, from English interference, from

English domination—not for freedom with any particular label

attached to it.


What we fought for at any particular time was the

greatest measure of freedom obtainable at that time, and it depended

upon our strength whether the claim was greater than at another time

or lesser than at another time.


When the national situation was very bad we lay inert;

when it improved a little we looked for Repeal of the Union; when it

receded again we looked for Home Rule under varying trade names; when

it went still worse we spoke of some form of devolution. When our

strength became greater our aim became higher, and we strove for a

greater measure of freedom under the name of a Republic. But it was

freedom we sought for, not the name of the form of government we

should adopt when we got our freedom.


When I supported the

approval of the Treaty at the meeting of Dáil Éireann I

said it gave us freedom—


---

p.29




 not the ultimate freedom which all nations hope for and

struggle for, but freedom to achieve that end. And I was, and am now,

fully alive to the implications of that statement.


Under the Treaty Ireland is about to become a fully

constituted nation. The whole of Ireland, as one nation, is to compose

the Irish Free State, whose parliament will have power to make laws

for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland, with an

executive responsible to that parliament.


This is the whole basis of the Treaty. It is the bedrock

from which our status springs, and any later Act of the British

Parliament derives its force from the Treaty only. We have got the

present position by virtue of the Treaty, and any forthcoming Act of

the British Legislature will, likewise, be by virtue of the

Treaty.


It is not the definition of any status which would secure

to us that status, but our power to make secure, and to increase what

we have gained; yet, obtaining by the Treaty the constitutional status

of Canada, and that status being one of freedom and equality, we are

free to take advantage of that status, and we shall set up our

Constitution on independent Irish lines. And no conditions mentioned

afterwards in the Treaty can affect or detract from the powers which

the mention of that status in the Treaty gives us, especially when it

has been proved, has been made good, by the withdrawal out of Ireland

of English authority of every kind.


In fact England has renounced all right to govern

Ireland, and the withdrawal of her forces is the proof


---

p.30




 of this. With the evacuation secured by the Treaty has

come the end of British rule in Ireland. No foreigner will be able to

intervene between our Government and our people. Not a single British

soldier, nor a single British official, will ever step again upon our

shores, except as guests of a free people.


Our Government will have complete control of our army,

our schools, and our trade. Our soldiers, our judges, our ministers

will be the soldiers, judges, and ministers of the Irish Free State.

We can send our own ambassadors to Washington, to Paris, to the

Vatican; we can have our own representatives on the League of Nations

(if we wish).


It was freedom we fought for—freedom from British

interference and domination. Let us ask ourselves these few questions:

Are the English going? To what extent are they going? If the Treaty is

put into operation will they, for all practical purposes, be gone?


The answer to the first question is to be seen in the

evacuation that is proceeding apace. We claimed that the Treaty would

secure this evacuation. The claim is being fulfilled. The Auxiliaries

are practically gone. The regular British military forces are rapidly

following them. The answer to the second and third questions is that

they remain for negligible purposes in that the extent to which they

remain is negligible.


We shall have complete freedom for all our purposes. We

shall be rid completely of British interference and British rule. We

can establish in its place our own rule, and exactly what kind of rule

we like. We can restore our Gaelic life in exactly what form we like.

We can keep what we have gained and make it secure


---

p.31




 and strong. The little we have not yet gained we can go

ahead and gain.


All other questions are really questions of arrangement,

in which our voice shall be the deciding voice. Any names, any

formulas, any figureheads, representing England's wish to conceal the

extent of her departure, to keep some pretence of her power over us,

which is now gone, will be but names, formulas, figureheads. England

exercised her power over us simply by the presence of her

forces—military forces, police forces, legal, and social

forces.


Is it seriously to be suggested that in the new order,

some functionary, no matter what we may call him, will serve the

purpose of all these forces, or, apart from him, the particular

interpretation of the words of a document?


The British Government could only be maintained by the

presence of British forces. Once these are gone the British Government

can no longer arrange the form our National Government and our

National life will take, nor can they set any limits to either. If we

wish to make our nation a free and a great and a good nation we can do

so now. But we cannot do it if we are to fight among ourselves as to

whether it is to be called Saorstát or Poblacht.


Whatever the name or the political phraseology, we cannot

restore Ireland without a great united effort.


Any difficulty now in making a noble Irish-Ireland will

lie in our people themselves and in the hundreds of years of

anglicisation to which we have been subjected. The task before us,

having got rid of the British, is to get rid of the British

influences—to


---

p.32




 de-anglicise ourselves; for there are many among us who

still cling to English ways, and any thoughtlessness, any

carelessness, will tend to keep things on the old lines—the

inevitable danger of the proximity of the two nations.


Can any restriction or limitation in the Treaty prevent

us making our nation great and potent? Can the presence of a

representative of the British Crown, depending on us for his

resources, prevent us from doing that? Can the words of a document as

to what our status is prevent us from doing that? One thing only can

prevent us—disunion among ourselves.


Can we not concentrate and unite, not on the negative,

but on the positive, task of making a real Ireland distinct from

Britain—a nation of our own?


The only way to get rid of British contamination and the

evils of corrupt materialism is to secure a united Ireland intent on

democratic ways, to make our free Ireland a fact, and not to keep it

for ever in dreamland as something that will never come true, and

which has no practical effect or reality except as giving rise to

everlasting fighting and destruction, which seem almost to have become

ends in themselves in the mind of some—some who appear to be

unheeding and unmindful of what the real end is.


Ireland is one—perhaps the only—country in

Europe which has now living hopes for a better civilization. We have a

great opportunity. Much is within our grasp. Who can lay a finger on

our liberties?


If any power menaces our liberties, we are in a stronger

position than before to repel the aggressor. That position will grow

stronger with each year of


---

p.33




 freedom if we will all unite for the aims we have in

common.


Let us advance and use these liberties to make Ireland a

shining light in a dark world, to reconstruct our ancient civilization

on modern lines, to avoid the errors, the miseries, the dangers, into

which other nations, with their false civilizations, have fallen.


In taking the Treaty we are not going in for the

flesh-pots of the British Empire—not unless we wish to. It is

futile to suppose that all these tendencies would disappear under

freedom by some other name, or that the government of an externally

associated nation, or of a Republic, any more than a Free State, would

be able to suppress them, and to force Gaelicism upon the nation.


Whatever form of free government we had, it would be the

Government of the Irish Nation. All the other elements, old Unionists,

Home Rulers, Devolutionists, would have to be allowed freedom and

self- expression. The only way to build the nation solid and Irish is

to effect these elements in a friendly national way—by

attraction, not by compulsion, making them feel themselves welcomed

into the Irish Nation, in which they can join and become absorbed, as

long ago the Geraldines and the de Burgos became absorbed.


The Treaty is already vindicating itself. The English

Die-hards said to Mr. Lloyd George and his Cabinet: ‘You have

surrendered’. Our own Die-hards said to us: ‘You have

surrendered’. There is a simple test. Those who are left in

possession of the battlefield have won.

ALTERNATIVE TO THE TREATY
-------------------------


### Ireland ‘A Mother Country’

#### Document No. 2 Analysed


The main difference between the Treaty and the

alternative proposals put forward by Mr. de Valera (known as Document

No. 2) is that one is signed by the Plenipotentiaries of both nations

and has been approved by the representatives of both nations; the

other is not signed.


In my belief it would not be signed in its present form;

not, indeed, that it contains much that is not in the Treaty, nor that

it contains much that England objects to, but simply that in its

construction it is too loose. Undoubtedly, in the application of its

details we should constantly have been faced with conflicting

interpretations leading to inevitable discordance.


It was claimed for the document by its sponsors that it

would be approved by the English people; that, on the other hand,

England never kept a Treaty, nor would she keep the present Treaty.

The inference, of course, is that England would keep a Treaty which

she had not signed but would not keep a Treaty which she had

signed.




---

p.36


The document was not drafted by Mr. de Valera. There is

little difficulty in guessing the author. Dominionism tinges every

line. No Irishman who understands the tradition and the history of

Ireland would think or write of his country's aspirations in the terms

used in this document. In the official laudation given it by the organ

of its supporters the following occurs:


Clauses 3 and 4 must be read together. What they mean is

this, that the association in matters of common

concern shall be a free one, not binding Ireland to submit to the

decisions either of the British alone or of a majority of the States

of the Commonwealth of which Britain is one.


"It is on that footing that an Irish representative would

attend meetings of the body known as the Imperial

Conference, consisting of Dominion Premiers and British Cabinet

Ministers to discuss and co-operate in matters of common concern. That is the footing on which the

Commonwealth States act together now, and the words within quotation

marks at the end of Clause 4 are taken from what is known as the

Constitutional Resolution passed at the Imperial Conference of

1917.


It will be seen that the Commonwealth States, including

Britain are bound to consultation and no more.

They are free to take action ‘as their several Governments may

determine’—a partnership based on individual freedom. Ireland

would be in the same position.




---

p.37


Thus, Ireland is by our own free offer, under this

document, represented at the Imperial Conference. Our status is taken

from a Constitutional Resolution passed at an Imperial Conference. The

outlook of the author of the document is bounded entirely by the

horizon of the British Empire.


This is not my stand, and at a Conference in London with

the British representatives I made it quite clear that Ireland was A

MOTHER COUNTRY, with the duties and responsibilities and feelings and

devotions of a mother country.


This simple statement had more effect on the British

delegates than all the arguments about Dominion status, or all the

arguments basing the claim of our historic nation on any new-found

idea. Irish nationhood springs from the Irish people, not from any

comparison with any other nation, not from any equality—inherent

or acquired—with any other nation.


Clause 1 of the document, which states: ‘That the

legislative, executive and judicial authority of Ireland shall be

derived solely from the people of Ireland’, is a declaration of

rights more suitable to form the basis of the Constitution of a free

nation than to be incorporated in a Treaty of Peace between two

nations that had been at war.


The opponents of the Treaty were most insistent on the

argument that it was Britain (by passing the Treaty through her

parliament) who conferred on us the Rights and Powers of the Treaty.

But we definitely stipulate for a like British acquiescence in

Document No. 2.




---

p.38


That is clear from the clause asking for ratification by

the British Parliament. British ratification is a legal thing. It is

no worse in one case than in the other. It is no better either. But

surely no one recognises any right in Britain to agree or to disagree

with that fundamental principle of freedom which concerns the people

of Ireland alone.


In fact, the Treaty secures this position. Under the

Treaty the English will no longer have any legislative, executive, or

judicial authority in Ireland.


All such authority will be vested in the Parliament of

Ireland, which alone will have power to make laws for the peace,

order, and good government of Ireland.


Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the document are all a loose

paraphrase of the Treaty, dangerous and misleading in their looseness.

They read:

1. ‘That for purposes of common concern Ireland shall be associated with the

States of the British Commonwealth, viz., the Kingdom of Great

Britain, the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the

Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa’.
2. ‘That while voting as an associate, the

rights, status, and privileges of Ireland shall be in no respect less

than those enjoyed by any of the component States of the British

Commonwealth’.
3. ‘That the matters of common concern shall include Defence, Peace and

War, Political Treaties, and all matters now treated as of 


---

p.39


common concern amongst the States of the

British Commonwealth, and that in these matters there shall be between

Ireland and the States of the British Commonwealth such concerted

action, founded on consultation, as the several Governments may

determine’.



Under these clauses Ireland would be committed to an

association so vague that it might afford grounds for claims by

Britain which might give her an opportunity to press for control in

Irish affairs as common concerns, and to use,

or to threaten to use, force. The Irish people could not have been

asked, and would not have agreed, to commit themselves to anything so

vague.


Clause 4 does not mend the matter; it makes it worse, as

common concern may include anything else

besides the things named. In fact, it is common knowledge that there

are many common concerns in the inter-dealings between the various

States of the Commonwealth.


This is a very vital point. We know that there are many

things which the States of the British Commonwealth can afford to

regard as common concerns which we could not

afford so to regard. This is where we must be careful to protect

ourselves as best we can against the disadvantages of geographical

propinquity This is where we had to find some form of association

which would safeguard us, as far as we could be safeguarded, in

somewhat the same degree as the 3,000 miles of ocean safeguards

Canada.


And it is obvious that the ‘association with the

British Commonwealth’ mentioned in the British


---

p.40




 Prime Minister's invitation, which was accepted by Mr. de

Valera on behalf of Dáil Éireann, meant association of a

different kind from that of mere alliance of isolated nations, and now

to suggest otherwise is not straightforward.


The question was of an association which would be

honourable to Ireland, which would give us full freedom to manage our

own affairs, and prevent interference by Britain; which would give the

maximum security that this freedom would be observed (and we may be

trusted to see that it is so observed), and which would be acceptable

to Ireland as recognising her nationhood.


We negotiated from the standpoint of an independent

sovereign nation, with a view to finding means of being honourably

associated with the British group of nations in a way in which we were

not associated with them before the negotiations.


The link which binds that group is a link which binds

free nations in a voluntary association. This is what we obtained in

the Treaty—freedom within our nation, freedom of association

without.


The external association mentioned in Document No. 2 has

neither the honesty of complete isolation (a questionable advantage in

these days of warring nationalities when it is not too easy for a

small nation to stand rigidly alone) nor the strength of free

partnership satisfying the different partners. Such external

association was not practical politics.


Actually in this regard the terms of the Treaty are less

objectionable than the formulas of the document. Restrictions in the

Treaty there unquestionably are.


---

p.41




 Restrictions in Document No. 2 equally unquestionably

there are. *But the Treaty will be operative, and the

restrictions must gradually tend to disappear as we go on more and

more strongly solidifying and establishing ourselves as a free

nation*.


Clause 5. ‘That in virtue of this association of

Ireland with the States of the British Commonwealth citizens of

Ireland in any of these States shall not be subject to any

disabilities which a citizen of one of the component States of the

British Commonwealth would not be subject to, and reciprocally for

citizens of these States in Ireland’ is unintelligible, and does

not meet the Irish wish to have some sentimental and racial ties with

all the children of our race. The expression common

citizenship in the Treaty is not ideal, but it is less

indefinite, and it does not attempt to confine Ireland's mother claims

to the States of the British Commonwealth.


Clause 6. ‘That for purposes of association, Ireland

shall recognise his Britannic Majesty as head of association’ gives

the recognition of the British Crown—a recognition which is as

precise as any given in the Treaty.


It was after discussion of this clause that Mr. de

Valera's alternative oath was produced. That oath, which has already

been published, was incorporated in a document submitted to the

British by the Irish delegation. It reads as follows:


---

p.42




 ‘I do swear to bear true faith and allegiance to the

Constitution of Ireland and to the Treaty of Association of Ireland

with the British Commonwealth of Nations, and to recognise the King of

Great Britain as head of the Associated States’. It was explained

at the Dáil debate by one of the foremost anti-Treatyites that

the King of Great Britain could be regarded as a managing director,

the explanation being that in these modern days industrial concerns

were amalgamating and entering into agreements, etc.


The King of Great Britain would then occupy the same

relative position towards the Associated States as a managing director

occupied towards associated businesses. Whereupon it was very wisely

pointed out by a journalist who was listening to the debate that a

managing director is one who manages and directs. After all, whatever

we may say of royal prerogatives, or anything of that kind, no modern

democratic nation is managed and directed by one ruler.


Plain people will not be impressed by this managing

director nonsense. Plain people will see no difference between these

oaths.


We must always rely upon our own strength to keep the

freedom we have obtained and to make it secure. And the constitutional

status of Canada, defined in the Treaty, gives us stronger assurance

of our immunity from interference by Britain than the indefinite

clauses in Document No. 2.


These clauses have nothing effective to back them.


---

p.43




 They have practically all the disadvantages of the Treaty.

It is too uncertain to have our future relationship based on ifs and unless and terms

like ‘so far as our resources permit’. These attempts at

improvement are nothing but dangerous friction spots which it is the

interest of Ireland to avoid.


Much has been said by the opponents of the Treaty about

‘buttressing up the British Empire’. All these defence clauses in

Document No. 2 are open to exactly the same attack. Under these

clauses we could not assist an Indian or Egyptian craft that happened

to get into Irish waters. These countries are at war with Britain, and

we should be bound by our proffered agreement to help Britain.


Under the Treaty we should have a representative on the

League of Nations (if we approved of a League of Nations), and that

representative would have a real power to prevent aggression against

Egypt and India.


To deal with Clauses 7 and 10 together, these clauses

have reference to the matter of defence, and to the ordinary observer

there is little difference between them and the clauses of the Treaty

covering the same subject.


The Treaty secures that the harbours at certain ports can

be used only for purposes of common defence, and not for any purpose

of interfering with Irish freedom (and, again, we may be trusted to

ensure that this shall be so).


There is one other thing under these clauses that I

should like to explain from my own knowledge of how the matter arose.

The British representatives made it quite clear to us that the British

people could not, or


---

p.44




 would not, for the sake of their own safety, allow any

Irish Government to build submarines. Document No. 2 concedes this

British claim fully. Britain does not mind if we build a dreadnought

or two, a battleship or two. One submarine would be a greater menace

to her than these. Document No. 2, therefore, gives way to her on the

only point that really matters. Such a concession to British

necessity, real or supposed, is nothing but dishonesty. Let us agree,

if need be, that we shall not build submarines; but don't let us

pretend that we are doing it from any motive other than the real

motive.


The remaining clauses seem nothing but a repetition of

the clauses of the Treaty, with only such slight verbal alterations as

no one but a factionist looking for means of making mischief would

have thought it worth while to have risked wrecking the Treaty

for.


It is fair criticism that the Treaty contains obsolete

phraseology no longer suited to the status of freedom and equality of

the States of the British Commonwealth and out of touch with the

realities of our freedom. But phraseology does not alter the fact of

our freedom, and we have the right and will exercise the right, to use

a form of words to secure an interpretation more in accordance with

the facts.


As an improvement on the Treaty Document No. 2 is not

honest. It may be more dictatorial in language. It does not contain in

principle a ‘greater reconciliation with Irish national

aspirations’. It merely attaches a fresh label to the same parcel,

or, rather, a label written, on purpose, illegibly in the hope of

making belief that the parcel is other than it is.

THE PROOF OF SUCCESS
--------------------


### What the Rising of 1916 did

#### Disunion Danger


Ireland is an ancient nation which from earliest times

had a distinct civilization. What made Ireland what she was was her

people living within the whole island as a separate and distinct

community, or nation, by virtue of a common system of law and culture

and traditions and ways of life and not depending upon any particular

political constitutions. While this lasted strangers who came were

absorbed, and the national ways were not interfered with, and were

such, by their attractiveness, as to enable strangers to become Irish

easily and thoroughly.


Then came English interference, and her policy of robbery

and exploitation, and when she had conquered us

sufficiently she began to carry out her policy—to use us to feed

and enrich herself. But having a complete nationhood of our own, which

Britain had to acknowledge or to trample out of existence, and having

a social system which suited us, and which gave our people security in

all their rights and privileges, England found the execution of her

policy, though helped by our geographical propinquity, a less


---

p.46




 easy task in Ireland than in her colonies, where there was

no separate nationhood and no difference of social polity.


England's idea was to make Ireland an English province.

For her purposes Irish civilization was to be completely blotted out.

The Gael was to go. Our lands were to be confiscated and given to

aliens. Our industries were to be effectively destroyed. Everything

that tended to remind us of the past, everything that tended to retain

our Irish outlook, everything that helped to keep us a distinct

people, everything that tended to keep alive in us our memories of our

Gaelic civilization and of our Irish nationality, freedom, and

prosperity, was to be obliterated.


Her method even then was to divide and rule, setting

chief against chief, as later she set religion against religion.


This policy could not succeed while we had a land system

by which men's rights in the land were secure and impregnable. By

means of wholesale commandeering the land was taken from the people,

and the feudal system of tenure, a system admirably suited for the

purpose of enslavement, was imposed. The free men of Ireland, whose

rights had been rooted in the soil, became the tenants, the serfs, of

the usurpers, and were completely at the mercy of their new masters,

the landlords, who joined with the enemy in the policy of robbing,

exploiting, and exterminating the Irish people.


When England had succeeded in uprooting the old Irish

system of land tenure under which everyone securely enjoyed land to

cultivate and common rights of grazing, she had taken the biggest step

in


---

p.47




 our subjection. It was only in so far as it attempted to

reverse that subjection that the land campaign of the Davitt period

was justified.


Some historian has yet to take up this aspect of the land

struggle and discover a national spirit seeking to manifest itself in

apparently strange ways. Were it not for this the killing of landlords

would have been murder. The people undoubtedly regarded it in this

way. The landlords were the agents who had taken away the liberties of

the common folk, and the common folk hit at the agent whom they

recognised as the common enemy.


They took first things first. They did the job which was

immediately to their hands. In our generation we have no longer to

shoot landlords, for landlords as they were known have mostly gone. In

the same way we hope that the next generation will have no necessity

to shoot an enemy, for the enemy will have gone.


In furtherance of the same policy the suppression of our

industries was also necessary if Britain's desire was to be realised.

It was doubly necessary. Our manufacturers competed too successfully

with hers, and it was to be our privilege to exist, not as an

industrial people, but for the purpose of providing England with an

abundance of food.


The destruction of our democratic Gaelic social system,

the discouragement, the prohibition of all enterprise, leaving us only

a slave life on the land, and the imposition upon us of an alien

language, alien laws, alien ideas, made our subjugation complete. Our

economic subjection was necessary that we might serve Britain's

purposes. Our spiritual subjection was


---

p.48




 no less necessary that we might learn to forget our former

national and economic freedom and acquiesce and grow passive in our

servitude.


And we learned our lesson. We forgot our freedom. We

forgot our language. We forgot our own native Irish ways. We forgot

our Irish love and veneration for things of the mind and character,

our pride in learning, in the arts for which we had been famous, in

military skill, in athletic prowess, in all which had been our glory

from the days of Cormac MacArt and St. Patrick and before them.


We became the degraded and feeble imitators of our

tyrants. English fashions, English material tastes and customs were

introduced by the landlord class or adopted by them, and by a natural

process they came to be associated in the minds of our people with

gentility. The outward sign of a rise in the social scale became the

extent to which we cast off everything which distinguished us as Irish

and the success with which we imitated the enemy who despised us.


And slavery still exists.


To-day in Ireland, although through improved economic

conditions, which have been world-wide and in which it was not

possible altogether to prevent us sharing, helped by a better living

on the land, bought very dearly by the purchase back again of a great

part of our country from those who had never any right to it, we have

been lifted out of the worst slough of destitution; although we have

been turning our eyes towards the light of liberty and learning to

lift our heads again as Irish men and Irish women with a land of our

own, and with traditions and hopes of which no


---

p.49




 nation need feel ashamed, yet still from east to west,

from north to south, we are soaked, saturated, and stupefied with the

English outlook.


Only slowly, laboriously, do we turn in our chains and

struggle to free ourselves from the degrading lie that what is English

is necessarily respectable, and what is Irish, low and mean. Even at

this moment when our daily papers and our weekly papers are writing of

our newly-won freedom and rejoicing over our national hopes, they

continue to announce in their leading columns the movements of English

society and the births and marriages of upper-class English

nonentities.


But by the completeness with which England converted us

into hewers of wood and drawers of water, she in the end defeated her

own purpose.


Feebly resisting at the moments when we were less

completely crushed, when a brief interval came between the long

periods of starvation, when we had a moment in which we could reflect

upon our condition, we gradually awoke to the cause of our miseries,

and we grew to learn if we would be economically free we must be

nationally free, and if we would be spiritually free we must be

nationally free.


The coming and the presence of the English had deprived

us of life and liberty. Their ways were not our ways. Their interests

and their purposes meant our destruction. We must turn back again the

wheels of that infamous machine which was destroying us. We must get

the English out of Ireland.


Our efforts at first were naturally timid, and they were

often futile because we were too much concerned


---

p.50




 with the political side—confused in this by the

example of England where nationality was always expressed that way,

and was principally a matter of political organisation.


Repeal of the Union was little more than a cry gaining

what real strength it had from the more vigorous hostility of the

Young Ireland movement, which revived our old literature, which

recovered Irish history, and spread a new spirit. That spirit was not

wholly martial, but what Irishman will say to-day that it was not

beneficial, even so?


The Fenians came and once and for all raised the banner

of Ireland's freedom, with a definite military policy which, though

unsuccessful at the time, had its full effect in bringing before men's

minds the real road to Irish salvation.


The Fenian idea left a torch behind it with which Tom

Clarke and Seán MacDermott kindled the fires of Easter Week,

and, though seemingly quenched, these were soon blazing brightly again

at Solohead, at Clonfin, at Macroom, at Dublin, at many a place in

Clare, in Mayo, and Monaghan, and Donegal during the recent

struggle.


After the Fenians, years of death again, while famine

raged over the land, till Parnell emerged to struggle for independence

under the name of Home Rule which, though accompanied by the social

and economic revolt of Davitt's national land policy, was bringing us

back again to the dangerous idea of seeking freedom by means of some

form of political weapon.


The weakness inherent in Parnell's policy was obviated by

his intense personal hostility to the English.


---

p.51




 He never forgot the end in the means. But it lost that

saving protection when it fell into the hands of those who succeeded

him and who, in the lotus-like atmosphere of the Westminster

Parliament, forgot the national spirit and lost touch with the minds

and feelings of their countrymen.


The collapse came when in the hands of weaker men the

national effort became concentrated at the foreign parliament on

English political lines. The methods adopted by the parliamentarians,

the forum they had chosen, made their crumbling an easy matter, and

from the English point of view it greatly helped division in their

ranks, and with division came the inevitable dissipation of

energy.


We would have an identical situation to-day had we chosen

the same methods and fought on the same battlefield for the last five

years. In that parliamentary period, however, the people at home were

growing in national consciousness and in strength and courage. The

Gaelic revival and the learning of our national tongue were teaching a

new national self-respect. We recalled the immortal tales of our

ancient heroes, and we began to look to a future in which we could

have a proud, free, distinct nation worthy of the past.


We learned that what we wanted was not a political form

of Home Rule or any other kind or form of Home Rule, but a revival of

Gaelic life and ways. Economic thought and study showed us that the

poverty which afflicted us came from the presence of the English and

their control over us; had come from landlordism and the drain of

English taxation, the neglect of Irish


---

p.52




 resources, and the obstruction to Irish industries by the

domination of the English Parliament. And we saw that we must manage

these things for ourselves.


And, besides the hope of material emancipation, we grew

to think of love of our land, and all that it had given us and had

still to give us, and what we could make of it when it was our own

once more. And we became filled with a patriotic fervour before which,

when the time came, force would prove impotent. The expression of this

new hope and new courage manifested itself in the Easter Week

Rising.


The leaven of the old Fenianism had been at work in our

midst. Tom Clarke, a member of the old Fenian Brotherhood, came out

from jail after sixteen years' penal servitude to take up the work

where he had left it off.


Seán MacDermott, tramping through Ireland,

preached the Fenian gospel of a freedom which must be fought for,

enrolled recruits, and, by his pure patriotism and lovable unselfish

character, inspired all with whom he came in contact to emulate him

and to be worthy of his teaching.


Our army was in existence again. It was not brought into

being, as is wrongfully supposed, by the example of Carson's

recruiting in North-East Ulster. It needed no such example. It was

already in being—the old Irish Republican Brotherhood in fuller

force.


But England's manufactured resistance in the North-East

enabled our soldiers to come out into the open, with the advantage in

1916 of a Rising starting unexpectedly from the streets instead of

from underground. England was unable or unwilling to interfere


---

p.53




 with her own Orange instruments, and she did not dare,

therefore, to suppress ours.


Armed resistance was the indispensable factor in our

struggle for freedom. It was never possible for us to be militarily

strong, but we could be strong enough to make England uncomfortable

(and strong enough to make England too uncomfortable). While she

explains the futility of force (by others) it is the only argument she

listens to. For ourselves it had that practical advantage, but it was

above all other things the expression of our separate nationhood.


Unless we were willing to fight for our Nation, even

without any certainty of success, we acquiesced in the doctrine of our

national identity with England. It embodied, too, for us the spirit of

sacrifice, the maintenance of the ideal, the courage to die for it, so

that military efforts were made in nearly every generation. It was a

protest, too, against our anglicisation and demoralisation, a

challenge of spirit against material power, and as such bore

fruit.


The Rising of 1916 was the fruit.


It appeared at the time of the surrender to have failed,

but that valiant effort and the martyrdoms which followed it finally

awoke the sleeping spirit of Ireland.


It carried into the hearts of the people the flame which

had been burning in those who had the vision to see the pit into which

we were sinking deeper and deeper and who believed that a

conflagration was necessary to reveal to their countrymen the road to

national death upon which we were blindly treading.


The banner of Ireland's freedom had been raised and was

carried forward. During the Rising the leaders


---

p.54




 of Easter Week ‘declared a Republic’. But not as a

fact. We knew it was not a fact. It was a wonderful

gesture—throwing down the gauntlet of defiance to the enemy,

expressing to ourselves the complete freedom we aimed at, and for that

reason was an inspiration to us.


If the impossible had happened, and the Rising had

succeeded, and the English had surrendered and evacuated the country,

we would then have been free, and we could then have adopted the

republican form of government, or any other form we wished. But the

Rising did not succeed as a military venture. And if it had succeeded

it would have been the surrender and the evacuation which would have

been the proof of our success, not the name for, nor the form of, the

government we would have chosen. If we had still a descendant of our

Irish Kings left, we would be as free, under a limited monarchy, with

the British gone, as under a Republic.


The form of our government is our domestic Irish concern.

It does not affect the fact of our national freedom. Our national

freedom depends upon the extent to which we reverse the history of the

last 700 years, the extent to which we get rid of the enemy and get

rid of his control over our material and spiritual life.

FOUR HISTORIC YEARS
-------------------


### The Story of 1914-1918

#### How Ireland Made her Case Clear


The period from 1914 to 1918 is an important one in the

struggle for Irish freedom. It was a transition period. It saw a

wholesome and necessary departure from the ideas and methods which had

been held and adopted for a generation, and it is a period which is

misread by a great many of our people, even by some who helped that

departure, and who helped to win the success we have achieved.


The real importance of the Rising of 1916 did not become

apparent until 1918. It is not correct to say now that the assertion

of the republican principle which was stated by the leaders of the

Rising was upheld as the national policy without a break. The

declaration of a Republic was really in advance of national thought,

and it was only after a period of two years' propaganda that we were

actually able to get solidarity on the idea.


The European War, which began in 1914, is now generally

recognised to have been a war between two rival empires, an old one

and a new, the new becoming such a successful rival of the old,

commercially


---

p.56




 and militarily, that the world-stage was, or was thought

to be, not large enough for both.


Germany spoke frankly of her need for expansion, and for

new fields of enterprise for her surplus population. England, who

likes to fight under a high-sounding title, got her opportunity in the

invasion of Belgium. She was entering the war ‘in defence of the

freedom of small nationalities’.


America at first looked on, but she accepted the motive

in good faith, and she ultimately joined in as the champion of the

weak against the strong. She concentrated attention upon the principle

of self-determination and the

reign of law based upon the consent of the governed.


‘Shall’, asked President Wilson, ‘the military

power of any nation, or group of nations, be suffered to determine the

fortunes of peoples over whom they have no right to rule except the

right of force?’


But the most flagrant instance of the violation of this

principle did not seem to strike the imagination of President Wilson,

and he led the American nation—peopled so largely by Irish men

and women who had fled from British oppression—into the battle

and to the side of that nation which for hundreds of years had determined the fortunes of the Irish people against

their wish, and had ruled them, and was still ruling them, by no other

right than the right of force.


There were created by the Allied Powers half-a-dozen new

Republics as a demonstration of adherence to these principles. At the

same time, England's military subjection of Ireland continued. And

Ireland


---

p.57




 was a nation with claims as strong as, or stronger than,

those of the other small nations.


This subjugation constituted a mockery of those

principles, yet the expression of them before the world as principles

for which great nations were willing to pour out their blood and

treasure gave us the opportunity to raise again our flag of freedom

and to call the attention of the world to the denial of our claim.


We were not pro-German during the war any more than we

were pro- Bulgarian, pro-Turk, or anti-French. We were anti-British,

pursuing our age-long policy against the common enemy. Not only was

this our policy, but it was the policy that any weak nation would have

pursued in the same circumstances. We were a weak nation kept in

subjection by a stronger one, and we formed and adopted our policy in

light of this fact. We remembered that England's difficulty was

Ireland's opportunity, and we took advantage of her engagement

elsewhere to make a bid for freedom.


The odds between us were for the moment a little less

unequal. Our hostility to England was the common factor between

Germany and ourselves. We made common cause with France when France

was fighting. We made common cause with Spain when Spain was fighting

England. We made common cause with the Dutch when the Dutch were

fighting England.


It so happened that on this occasion England had put a

weapon into our hands against herself. The observation of the world

was focused upon the mighty European War. We could call attention to

the difference


---

p.58




 between England's principles as expounded to the world and

her practice as against ourselves. We were put into the position of

being able to force her to recognise our freedom or to oppress us for

proclaiming that simple right.


Our position was our old position. Our aim was our old

aim. Our intention was simply to secure liberation from the English

occupation and that which it involved.


The Rising expressed our right to freedom. It expressed

our determination to have the same liberty of choice in regard to our

own destinies as was conceded to Poland or Czecho-Slovakia, or any

other of the nations that were emerging as a result of the new

doctrines being preached. The Republic which was declared at the

Rising of Easter Week, 1916, was Ireland's expression of the freedom

she aspired to. It was our way of saying that we wished to challenge

Britain's right to dominate us.


Ireland wished to make it clear that she stood for a form

of freedom equal to that of any other nation. Other nations claimed

freedom, and their claims were conceded. Ireland's claim was no less

strong than the claim of any nation. We had as good a right to

recognition as Poland has. The position we adopted expressed our

repudiation of the British government.


The British form of government was monarchical. In order

to express clearly our desire to depart from all British forms, we

declared a Republic. We repudiated the British form of government, not

because it was monarchical, but because it was British. We would have

repudiated the claim of a British Republic


---

p.59




 to rule over us as definitely as we repudiated the claim

of the British monarchy.


Our claim was to govern ourselves, and the expression of

the form of government was an answer to the British lie that Ireland

was a domestic question. It was a gesture to the world that there

could be no confusion about. It was an emphasis of our separate

nationhood and a declaration that our ultimate goal was and would

continue to be complete independence.


It expressed our departure from the policy of

parliamentary strategy at Westminster. That policy had failed, as it

was bound to fail. It had two evils involved in it. While claiming

rightly to be a distinct nation, we had been acquiescing by our

actions in the convenient British doctrine that we were a British

province and an integral part of the United Kingdom—an

acquiescence which gave Mr. Lloyd George the opportunity to question

our right to freedom because for over a hundred years, he said, we had

sent representatives to Westminster, and soldiers to fight in every

British war.


And it had the evil effect of causing our people to look

to England for any ameliorative government, and even for the gift of an instalment of freedom, and away from

their own country, from themselves, who alone could give to themselves

these things. So we sank more and more into subjection during this

period, and it was only by a great educational effort that our

national consciousness was re-awakened.


We were to learn that freedom was to be secured by

travelling along a different road; that instead of it


---

p.60




 being possible for the English to bestow freedom upon us

as a gift (or by means of any Treaty signed or unsigned) that it was

their presence alone which denied it to us, and we must make that

presence uncomfortable for them, and that the only question between us

and them was the terms on which they would clear out and cease their

interference with us.


But we started along the new road, the only one that

could lead to freedom, at first with faltering steps, half doubtingly

looking back at the old paths which had become familiar, where we knew

the milestones at which we had been able to shift the burden from one

shoulder to another.


The Easter Week Rising pointed out the road. But after

that declaration of a Republic and all that it meant of repudiation of

Britain, we lapsed into the old way, or took but uncertain steps upon

the new one.


When the first by-election after the Rising took place in

North Roscommon in 1917, so much had the Republic of Easter Week been

forgotten and so little had its teachings yet penetrated to the minds

of the people, that, though the candidate was Count Plunkett, whose

son had been martyred after the Rising, he was returned only on the

ground of his opposition to the Irish Party candidate.


Abstention from attendance at the British Parliament was

the indispensable factor in the republican ideal—the repudiation

of foreign government. But it was only after his election that the

Count declared his intention not to go to Westminster, and the

announcement was not received very enthusiastically by some of the

most energetic of his supporters.


---

p.61




 They had returned a man, it was said, ‘who did not

intend to represent them anywhere’. Not only the people, but even

some who had been engaged in the Rising hardly grasped the new

teaching.


This election and others which followed were not won on

the policy of upholding a Republic, but on the challenge it made to

the old Irish Party.


There was at this stage no unity of opinion on the policy

of abstention among the various elements which formed the opposition,

which were joined together only on opposition to the Redmondites. At

what was known as the Plunkett Convention an

effort was made to get all the parts of the opposition united on such

a policy but the divergence of opinion was so great that, to avoid a

split, it was declared that there should be no greater union than a

loose co-operation.


The North Roscommon and the South Longford elections were

fought on the basis of this agreement, and there was no definite

united policy until the merging of all the sectional organisations

with Sinn Féin which occurred just prior to the great

�rd-Fheis of 1917.


At the South Longford election Mr. Joe McGuinness, who

was then still in penal servitude, was elected on the cry: ‘Put him

in to get him out’. Abstention was put forward, but was so little

upheld that he was returned with a majority of only 27.


At the East Clare election, though Mr. de Valera put

forward the abstentionist policy and was elected by a large majority,

he issued no election address, and at the three elections which

followed in South Armagh,


---

p.62




 Waterford, and East Tyrone, the abstentionists were

defeated.


But the people were becoming educated, and the union of

all the various sects and leagues in the big organisation of Sinn

Féin, as we have seen, defined the national policy as

definitely abstentionist.


The Republic of Easter Week had not lived on, as is

supposed, supported afresh at each election, and endorsed finally in

the General Election of 1918. But the people grew to put their trust

in the new policy, and to believe that the men who stood for it would

do their best for Ireland, and at the General Election of 1918, fought

on the principle of self-determination, they put them in power.

COLLAPSE OF THE TERROR
----------------------


### British Rule's Last Stages

#### What the Elections Meant


We have seen how in ancient Ireland the people were

themselves the guardians of their land, doing all for themselves

according to their own laws and customs, as interpreted by the

Brehons, which gave them security, prosperity, and national greatness,

and how this was upset by the English determination to blot out Irish

ways, when came poverty, demoralisation and a false respect for

English standards and habits.


The English power to do this rested on military

occupation and on economic control. It had the added advantage of

social influence operating upon a people weakened and demoralised by

the state of dependence into which the English occupation had brought

them.


Military resistance was attempted. Parliamentary strategy

was tried. The attempts did not succeed. They failed because they did

not go to the root of the question.


The real cure had to be started—that the people

should recover belief in their own ways and ideas and put them into

practice. Secret societies were formed


---

p.64




 and organised. The Land League came into existence. The

Gaelic League came. Sinn Féin grew and developed. All these

societies did much. But the effort had to be broadened into a national

movement to become irresistible. It became irresistible in the

Republican movement when it was backed by sufficient military force to

prevent the English forces from suppressing the national revival.


The challenge of Easter Week and its sacrifices increased

the growing national self-belief. All these things made a resistance

against which the English, with their superior forces, pitted

themselves in vain.


Ireland's story from 1918 to 1921 may be summed up as the

story of a struggle between our determination to govern ourselves and

to get rid of British government and the British determination to

prevent us from doing either. It was a struggle between two rival

Governments, the one an Irish Government resting on the will of the

people and the other an alien Government depending for its existence

upon military force—the one gathering more and more authority,

the other steadily losing ground and growing ever more desperate and

unscrupulous.


All the history of the three years must be read in the

light of that fact.


Ireland had never acquiesced in government by England.

Gone for ever were policies which were a tacit admission that a

foreign Government could bestow freedom, or a measure of freedom, upon

a nation which had never surrendered its national claim.


We could take our freedom. We would set up a Government

of our own and defend it. We would take the


---

p.65




 government out of the hands of the foreigner, who had no

right to it, and who could exercise it only by force.


A war was being waged by England and her Allies in

defence, it was said, of the freedom of small nationalities, to

establish in such nations ‘the reign of law based upon the consent

of the governed’. We, too, proposed to establish in Ireland ‘the

reign of law based upon the consent of the governed’.


At the General Election of 1918 the Irish Parliamentary

Party was repudiated by the Irish people by a majority of over 70 per

cent. And they gave authority to their representatives to establish a

National Government. The National Government was set up in face of

great difficulties. Dáil Éireann came into being.

British law was gradually superseded. Sinn Féin Courts were set

up. Commissions were appointed to investigate and report upon the

national resources of the country with a view to industrial revival.

Land courts were established which settled long-standing disputes.

Volunteer police were enrolled. (They were real police, to protect

life and property, not military police and police spies to act with an

enemy in attacks upon both.) A loan of £400,000 was raised. The

local governing bodies of the country were directed, inspected, and

controlled by Dáil Éireann. We established a bank to

finance societies which wished to acquire land.


But these facts must be concealed.


At first the British were content to ridicule the new

Government. Then, growing alarmed at its increasing authority,

attempts were made to check its activities by wholesale political

arrests.




---

p.66


The final phase of the struggle had begun.


In the first two years all violence was the work of the

British armed forces who in their efforts at suppression murdered

fifteen Irishmen and wounded nearly 400 men, women, and children.

Meetings were broken up everywhere. National newspapers were

suppressed. Over 1,000 men and women were arrested for political

offences, usually of the most trivial nature. Seventy-seven of the

national leaders were deported.


No police were killed during these two years. The only

disorder and bloodshed were the work of the British forces.


These forces were kept here or sent here by the British

Government to harass the development of Irish self-government. They

were intended to break up the national organisation. They were

intended to goad the people into armed resistance. Then they would

have the excuse which they hoped for. Then they could use wholesale

violence, and end up by the suppression of the national movement.


But they did not succeed.


In the municipal elections in January, 1920, the people

answered afresh. In the rural elections in May and June, 1920, the

people repeated their answer. The people supported their leaders and

their policy by even larger majorities than the majorities given by

the election in November, 1918.


The British Government now decided that a greater effort

was needed. The moment had come for a final desperate campaign.


The leading London newspaper, The Times,

declared in a leading article of November 1st, 1920, that it was


---

p.67




 ‘now generally admitted’ that a deliberate policy of

violence had been ‘conceived and sanctioned in advance by an

influential section of the Cabinet’.


But to admit such a policy was impossible. It was

necessary to conceal the real object of the Reign of Terror, for the

destruction of the national movement, which was about to begin.


First, the ground had to be prepared. In August, 1920, a

law was passed ‘to restore law and order in Ireland’. This law in

reality abolished all law in Ireland, and left the lives and property

of the people defenceless before the British forces. It facilitated

and protected—and was designed to facilitate and

protect—those forces in the task they were about to undertake.

Coroners' inquests were prohibited, so that no inquiry could be made

into the acts of violence contemplated. National newspapers, that

could not be trusted to conceal the facts and to publish only supplied

information, were suppressed. Newspaper correspondents were

threatened.


The ground prepared, special instruments had to be

selected. ‘It is’, said the London Times,

‘common knowledge that the Black and Tans were recruited from

ex-soldiers for a rough and dangerous task’. This ‘rough and

dangerous task’, which had been ‘conceived and sanctioned’ by

the British Cabinet, was to be carried out under three headings.

Certain leading men, and Irish Army officers, were to be murdered,

their names being entered on a list ‘for definite clearance’. All

who worked for or supported the national movement were to be

imprisoned, and the general population was to be terrorised into

submission.




---

p.68


A special newspaper, The Weekly Summary,

was circulated amongst the Crownage to encourage them in their

‘rough and dangerous task’. As an indication of its intention it

invited them in an early number ‘to make an appropriate hell’ in

Ireland.


Excuses, for the purpose of concealment, had to be

invented. The public had to be prepared for the coming campaign. Mr.

Lloyd George in a speech in Carnarvon, October 7, 1920, spoke of the

Irish Republican Army as ‘a real murder gang’. We began to hear

of ‘steps necessary to put down a murderous conspiracy’. ‘We

have got murder by the throat’, said Mr. Lloyd George.


The murders were the legitimate

acts of self-defence which had been forced upon the Irish people by

English aggression. After two years of forbearance, we had begun to

defend ourselves and the life of our nation. We did not initiate the

war, nor were we allowed to select the battleground. When the British

Government, as far as lay in its power, deprived the Irish people of

arms, and employed every means to prevent them securing arms, and made

it a criminal (in large areas a capital) offence to carry arms, and,

at the same time, began and carried out a brutal and murderous

campaign against them and against their National Government, they

deprived themselves of any excuse for their violence and of any cause

of complaint against the Irish people for the means they took for

their protection.


For all the acts of violence committed in Ireland from

1916 to 1921 England, and England alone, is responsible. She willed

the conflict and fixed the form it was to take.




---

p.69


On the Irish side it took the form of disarming the

attackers. We took their arms and attacked their strongholds. We

organised our army and met the armed patrols and military expeditions

which were sent against us in the only possible way. We met them by an

organised and bold guerilla warfare.


But this was not enough. If we were to stand up against

the powerful military organisation arrayed against us something more

was necessary than a guerilla war in which small bands of our

warriors, aided by their knowledge of the country, attacked the larger

forces of the enemy and reduced their numbers. England could always

reinforce her army. She could replace every soldier that she lost.


But there were others indispensable for her purposes

which were not so easily replaced. To paralyse the British machine it

was necessary to strike at individuals. Without her spies England was

helpless. It was only by means of their accumulated and accumulating

knowledge that the British machine could operate.


Without their police throughout the country, how could

they find the men they wanted? Without their

criminal agents in the capital, how could they carry out that removal of the leaders that they considered

essential for their victory? Spies are not so ready to step into the

shoes of their departed confederates as are soldiers to fill up the

front line in honourable battle. And even when the new spy stepped

into the shoes of the old one, he could not step into the old one's

knowledge.


The most potent of these spies were Irishmen enlisted in

the British service and drawn from the


---

p.70




 small farmer and labourer class. Well might every Irishman

at present ask himself if we were doing a wrong thing in getting rid

of the system which was responsible for bringing these men into the

ranks of the opponents of their own race.


We struck at individuals, and by so doing we cut their

lines of communication and we shook their morale. And we conducted the

conflict, difficult as it was, with the unequal terms imposed by the

enemy, as far as possible, according to the rules of war. Only the

British Government were attacked. Prisoners of war were treated

honourably and considerately, and were released after they had been

disarmed.


On the English side they waged a sort of war, but did not

respect the laws and usages of war. When our soldiers fell into their

hands they were murderers, to be dealt with by

the bullet or the rope of the hangman. They were dealt with mostly by

the bullet. Strangely enough, when it became law that prisoners attempting to escape should be

shot, a considerable larger number of our prisoners attempted to escape than when the greatest penalty

to be expected was recapture.


The fact was that when the men whose names were upon the list were identified at once, they were

shot at once. When they were identified during a raid, they were taken

away and shot while attempting to escape. Or

they were brought to Dublin Castle or other place of detention and

questioned under torture, and on refusing to give information were

murdered because they revolted, seized arms, and attacked their

guards.




---

p.71


For these murders no members of the British forces were

brought to justice. The perpetrators were but enforcing the law—restoring

law and order in Ireland   
[*gap: ellipsis*]  
. No matter now

damaging the evidence, the prisoners were invariably acquitted.

Necessarily so. They were but carrying out the duties which they had

been specially hired at a very high rate of pay to execute.


To excuse the terrible campaign, the world began to hear

of reprisals, the natural

outbreaks of the rank and file, A campaign which could no longer

be concealed had to be excused—a campaign in which sons were

murdered before the eyes of their mothers—in which fathers were

threatened with death and done to death because they would not tell

the whereabouts of their sons—in which men were made to crawl

along the streets, and were taken and stripped and flogged, and sent

back naked to their homes—in which towns and villages and homes

were burned, and women and children left shivering in the fields.


Excuses were necessary for such deeds, and we began to

hear of some hitting back by the gallant men who are doing their duty in

Ireland. The London Westminster Gazette of October 27, 1920, published a message from

their own correspondent at Cork which gives an instance of the way in

which these gallant men performed their duty: ‘A motor lorry of uniformed men, with

blackened faces, arrived in Lixane from the Ballybunion district.

Before entering the village they pulled up at the house of a farmer

named 


---

p.72


 Patrick McElligott. His two sons were pulled outside

the door in night attire in a downpour of rain, cruelly beaten with

the butt ends of rifles and kicked. The party then proceeded to the

house of a young man named Stephen Grady, where they broke in the

door. Grady escaped in his night attire through the back window.

Searchlights were turned on him, but he made good his escape through

the fields. His assistant, named Nolan, was knocked unconscious on the

floor with a rifle, and subsequently brought outside the door almost

nude and a tub of water poured over him. The party then broke into the

room where Miss Grady and her mother were sleeping, pulled Miss Grady

out on the road and cut her hair’.


The account tells of the burning of the creamery and of

further escapades of the gallant men on their

return through the village.


An instance symbolic of the fight, of the devotion and

self- sacrifice on the one side, and the brutish insensibility on the

other, was the murder on October 25,

1920, of young Willie Gleeson, of Finaghy, Co. Tipperary.

Officers of the British Army Intelligence Staff raided the house of

his father, looking for another of his sons. Hearing his father

threatened with death if he would not (or could not) disclose where

his son was, Willie came from his bed and offered himself in place of

his father. The offer was accepted, and he was taken out into the yard

and shot dead.




---

p.73


On the same night the same party (presumably) murdered

Michael Ryan, of Curraghduff, Co. Tipperary, in the presence of his

sister. Ryan was lying ill in bed with pneumonia and the sister

described the scene in which one officer held a candle over the bed to

give better light to his comrade in carrying out the deed.


Such reprisals could not be

explained as a severe hitting back, and a new

excuse was forthcoming. They were suggested as a just retribution

falling upon murderers.


Mr. Lloyd George was ‘firmly convinced that the men who

are suffering in Ireland are the men who are engaged in a murderous

conspiracy’. At the London Guildhall he announced that the police

were ‘getting the right men’. As it became more and more

difficult to conceal the truth the plea of unpremeditation was

dropped, and the violence was explained as legitimate acts of self-

defence.


But when the Terror, growing evermore violent, and,

consequently, ever more ineffective, failed to break the spirit of the

Irish people—failed as it was bound to fail—concealment

was no longer possible, and the true explanation was blurted out when

Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Bonar Law declared that their acts were

necessary to destroy the authority of the Irish National Government

which ‘has all the symbols and all the realities of

government’.


When such a moment had been reached, there was only one

course left open for the British Prime Minister—to invite the

Irish leaders, the murderers, and heads of the murder gang to discuss with him terms

of peace. The invitation was:


---

p.74




 ‘To discuss terms of peace—to ascertain how the

association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the

British Empire may best be reconciled with Irish national

aspirations’.


We all accepted that invitation.




---

p.75


PARTITION ACT'S FAILURE
-----------------------


### Unity as a Means to Full Freedom


While the Terror in Ireland was at its height the British

Cabinet passed the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, better known as

the Partition Act. It is not quite clear what was in the minds of the

British Prime Minister and his Cabinet in passing this measure. Nobody

representing any Irish constituency voted for it in the British

Parliament.


Nationalist Ireland took advantage of its election

machinery only to repudiate the Act and to secure a fresh mandate from

the people. Otherwise the Act was completely ignored by us. In the Six

Counties almost one-fourth of the candidates were returned in

non-recognition of the Act, while Sir James Craig himself said, they

(he and his friends) accepted the parliament conferred upon them by

the Act only as ‘a great sacrifice’.


The Act was probably intended for propaganda purposes. It

might do to allay world criticism—to draw attention away from

British violence for a month or two longer. At the end of that period

Ireland would, it was hoped, have been terrorised into submission.


---

p.76




 That desired end gained, a chastened nation would accept

the crumb of freedom offered by the Act. Britain, with her idea of the

principles of self-determination satisfied, would be able to present a

bold front again before the world.


There was, probably, too, an understanding with the

Orange leaders. The act entrenched them (or appeared to) within the

Six Counties. No doubt, both the British and Orange leaders had it in

mind that if a bigger settlement had ultimately to be made with

Ireland, a position was secured from which they could bargain.


In any settlement the North-East

was to be let down gently by the British Government. Pampered for so

long they had learned to dictate to and to bully the nation to which

they professed to be loyal. They must be treated with tact in regard

to any change of British policy towards Ireland.


They had been very useful. When the Partition Act failed

to achieve what was expected of it, and when the Terror failed, a real

settlement with Ireland became inevitable. The North-East was now no

longer useful to prevent Irish freedom, but she could be useful in

another way. She could buttress Britain's determination that, while

agreeing to our freedom, Ireland must remain associated with the

British group of nations. Britain's reason for insisting upon this

association is that she believes it necessary for her own national

safety.


Were Britain to go to that, her maximum, it could be

represented to us that the North-East would never acquiesce in more.

It could be represented to them


---

p.77




 that in such a settlement they would be preserving that

which they professed to have at heart, the sentimental tie with the

Empire to which they were supposed to be attached.


North-East Ulster had been created and maintained not for

her own advantage, but to uphold Britain's policy. Everything was done

to divide the Irish people and to keep them apart. If we could be made

to believe we were the enemies of each other, the real enemy would be

overlooked. In this policy Britain has been completely successful. She

petted a minority into becoming her agents with the double advantage

of maintaining her policy and keeping us divided.


Long ago, setting chief against chief served its purpose

in providing the necessary excuse for declaring our lands forfeited.

Plantations by Britain's agents followed. The free men of Ireland

became serfs on the lands of their fathers. Ireland, by these means,

was converted into a British beef farm, and when by force of change

and circumstances these means became outworn the good results were

continued by setting religion against religion and then worker against

worker.


If we were to be kept in subjection we must be kept

apart. One creed, the creed of the minority, was selected to be used

for the purpose of division and domination. ‘A Protestant garrison

was in possession of the land, magistracy, and power of the country,

holding that property under the tenure of British power and supremacy,

and ready at every instant to crush the rising of the conquered’.

Manufactures had become discouraged and destroyed throughout the


---

p.78




 greater part of Ireland. This was the outcome of British

jealousy, and was in accordance with Britain's settled policy towards

Ireland.


A revival took place during Grattan's Parliament, partly

owing to the war conditions prevailing, but also due to the protection

given to industry by the Parliament. The good effect lived on for a

little (only for a little) after the Union. A deep depression took

place in agriculture at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and

agriculture had become the sole industry of the Catholic population.

This gave the opportunity to point to the supposed superior qualities

of the Protestant industrial worker and to prejudice him still further

against his Catholic countrymen.


But North-East Ulster had not flourished and could not

flourish under a policy devised for English purposes. It has resulted

only in a general decline in prosperity throughout the whole country,

only in an uneconomic distribution of the disappearing wealth, only,

by contrast, in an appearance of prosperity in one section of the

people as compared with the other. The population of Ulster has

decreased by one-third since the 'forties. It is true that the

population of Belfast has increased in the last two generations, but

the two counties of Antrim and Down, in which Belfast is situated,

contain to- day fewer people than before the Famine of 1846-8.

Emigration has steadily increased. The number of emigrants from Down

and Antrim, including Belfast, has in the last ten years more than

doubled that of the preceding ten years.


If there has been any gain in wealth in North-East Ulster

as compared with the rest of Ireland, it is obvious


---

p.79




 that the wealth has not percolated through to the workers

for their weal. They, too, like their poor countrymen in Connemara,

have to seek better economic conditions in America and other

countries.


Capitalism has come, not only to serve Britain's purpose

by keeping the people divided, but, by setting worker against worker,

it has profited by exploiting both. It works on religious prejudices.

It represents to the Protestant workman any attempt by the Catholic

workman to get improved conditions as the cloak for some insidious

political game.


Such a policy—the policy of divide and rule, and

the opportunity it gives for private economic oppression—could

bring nothing but evil and hardship to the whole of Ireland.


If Britain had not maintained her interference and

carried out her policy the planters would have become absorbed in the

old Irish way. Protestant and Catholic would have learned to live side

by side in amity and co-operation. Freedom would have come long ago.

Prosperity would have come with it. Ireland would have taken her

rightful place in the world, the place due to her by her natural

advantages, the place due to her by the unique character of her

people.


Who will not say that from Britain's policy it is the

North-East which has suffered most? She has lost economically and

spiritually. She has suffered in reputation by allowing herself to be

used for anti-national purposes. She might have gained real wealth as

a sturdy and independent section of the population. She exchanged it

for a false ascendancy over her countrymen, which has brought her

nothing but dishonour. A


---

p.80




 large portion of her fair province has lost all its native

distinctiveness. It has become merely an inferior Lancashire. Who

would visit Belfast or Lisburn or Lurgan to see the Irish people at

home? That is the unhappy fate of the North-East. It is neither

English nor Irish.


But what of the future? The North-East is about to get

back into the pages of Irish history. Being no longer useful to

prevent Irish freedom, forces of persuasion and pressure are embodied

in the Treaty of Peace, which has been signed by the Irish and British

Plenipotentiaries, to induce North-East Ulster to join in a united

Ireland.


If they join in, the Six Counties will certainly have a

generous measure of local autonomy. If they stay out, the decision of

the Boundary Commission, arranged for in Clause 12, would be certain

to deprive Ulster of Fermanagh and Tyrone.


Shorn of those counties, she would shrink into

insignificance. The burdens and financial restrictions of the

Partition Act will remain on North-East Ulster if she decides to stay

out. No lightening of these burdens or restrictions can be effected by

the English Parliament without the consent of Ireland. Thus, union is

certain. The only question for North-East Ulster is—How

soon?


And that how soon may depend largely upon us, upon

ourselves of Nationalist Ireland. What if the Orangemen were to get

new allies in place of the departing British?


The opposition of Mr. de Valera and his followers to the

Treaty is already prejudicing the chances of unity. As the division in

our own ranks has become more


---

p.81




 apparent, the attitude of Sir James Craig has hardened.

The organised ruffianism of the North-East has broken out afresh.

British troops have been hurried to Ulster. The evacuation has been

suspended.


So long as there are British troops in Ireland so long

will the Orangemen hold out. While they can look to Britain they will

not turn towards the South. They are not giving up their ascendancy

without a struggle. Any Irishman who creates and supports division

amongst us is standing in the way of a united Ireland. While the

Treaty is threatened the British will remain. While the British remain

the North-East will keep apart. Just as the evil British policy of

divide and rule is about to end for ever, we are threatened with a new

division, jeopardising the hopes of Irish rule.


No geographical barrier could have succeeded in dividing

Ireland. The four or six counties are not counties of Great Britain;

they are counties of Ireland. While Britain governed Ireland the

North-East could remain apart, she giving allegiance where we gave

revolt. Once England surrenders her right to govern us (as she has

done under the Treaty) she surrenders her power to divide us. With the

British gone the incentive to division is gone.


The fact of union is too strong to be interfered with

without the presence of the foreigner bent on dividing us. With the

British gone the Orangeman loses that support which alone made him

strong enough to keep his position of domination and isolation.

Without British support he becomes what he is, one of a minority in

the Irish Nation. His rights are the same


---

p.82




 as those of every Irishman, but he has no rights other

than those.


But Britain leaves behind a formidable legacy in the

partition of view. That is there and it has to be dealt with. It is

for us, to whom union is an article of our national faith, to deal

with it.


Once the British are gone, I believe we can win our

countrymen to allegiance to our common country. Let us convince them

of our good will towards them. The first way of doing this is unity

among ourselves.


We have the task before us to impregnate our northern

countrymen with the national outlook. We have a million Protestant

Irishmen to convert out of our small population of four-and-a-half

millions. Is not that incentive enough to cause us to join together to

win a far greater victory than ever we got against the British? If we

could have won that victory, there would have been no enemy to

vanquish.


The tendency of the sentiment in the North-East, when not

interfered with, was national, and in favour of freedom and unity. In

that lies our hope.


It is this serious internal problem which argues for the

attainment of the final steps of freedom by evolution rather than by

force—to give time to the North-East to learn to revolve in the

Irish orbit and to get out of the orbit of Great Britain—in

fact, internal association with Ireland, external association with

Great Britain.


In acquiescing in a peace which involved some

postponement of the fulfilment of our national sentiment, by agreeing

to some association of our Irish nation with the British nations, we

went a long way


---

p.83




 towards meeting the sentiment of the North-East in its

supposed attachment to Great Britain. With such association Britain

will have no ground (nor power) for interference, and the North-East

no genuine cause for complaint.


Had we been able to establish a Republic at once (we are

all now agreed that that was not possible), we would have had to use

our resources to coerce North-East Ulster into submission. Will anyone

contend that such coercion, if it had succeeded, would have had the

lasting effects which conversion on our side and acquiescence on

theirs will produce?


The North-East has to be nationalised. Union must come

first, unity first as a means to full freedom. Our freedom then will

be built on the unshakable foundation of a united people, united in

every way, in economic co-operation, and in national outlook.


I have emphasised our desire for national unity above all

things. I have stated our desire to win the North-East for Ireland. We

mean to do our best in a peaceful way, and if we fail the fault will

not be ours.


The freedom we have secured may unquestionably be

incomplete. But it is the nearest approach to an absolutely

independent and unified Ireland which we can achieve amongst ourselves

at the present moment. It certainly gives us the best foothold for

final progress.


Let us not waste our energies brooding over *the more we might have got*. Let us look upon *what we have got*. It is a measure of freedom with

which we can make an actual, living Ireland when left to our selves.

Let us realise that the free Ireland obtained by


---

p.84




 the Treaty is the greatest common measure of freedom

obtainable now, and the most pregnant for future development.


The freedom we have got gives us scope for all that we

can achieve by the most strenuous united effort of the present

generation to rebuild Ireland.


Can we not all join together to save the Irish

ideal—freedom and unity—and to make it a reality?

WHY BRITAIN SOUGHT IRISH PEACE
------------------------------


### Her Failure to Subjugate Us

#### Making of Treaty


Peace with Ireland, or a good case for further, and what

would undoubtedly have been more intensive, war, had become a

necessity to the British Cabinet. Politicians of both the great

historic parties in Britain had become united in the conviction that

it was essential for the British to put themselves right with the

world. Referring to the peace offer which Mr. Lloyd George, on behalf

of his Cabinet and Parliament, had made to Mr. de Valera in July, 1921

(an offer which was not acceptable to the Irish people) Mr. Churchill

said on September 24th at Dundee: ‘This offer is put forward, not as

the offer of a party government confronted by a formidable opposition

and anxious to bargain for the Irish vote, but with the united

sanction of both the historic parties in the State, and, indeed, all

parties. It is a national offer’.


Yes. It was a national offer, representing the necessity

of the British to clean their Irish slate. The Premiers of the Free

Nations of the British Commonwealth were in England fresh from their

people. They were able to


---

p.86




 express the views of their people. The Washington

Conference was looming ahead. Mr. Lloyd George's Cabinet had its

economic difficulties at home. Their relationships with foreign

countries were growing increasingly unhappy, the recovery of world

opinion was becoming—in fact, had become—indispensable.

Ireland must be disposed of by means of a generous peace. If Ireland refused that settlement,

we could be shown to be irreconcilables. Then, Britain would again

have a free hand for whatever further actions were necessary ‘to

restore law and order’ in a country that would not accept the

responsibility of doing so for itself.


This movement by the British Cabinet did not indicate any

real change of heart on the part of Britain towards Ireland. Any

stirrings of conscience were felt only by a minority. This minority

was largely the same minority that had been opposed to Britain's

intervention in the European War. They were the peaceful group of the

English people that is averse from bloodshed on principle, no matter

for what purpose, or by whom, carried out. They were opposed to the

killing we had to do in selfdefence quite as much as they were opposed

to the aggressive killing of our people by the various British agents

sent here. These pacifists were almost without any political power and

had very little popular support.


Peace had become necessary. It was not because Britain

repented in the very middle of her Black and Tan terror. It was not

because she could not subjugate us before world conscience was

awakened and was able to make itself felt. ‘The progress of the

coercive attempts made by the Government have proved in a 


---

p.87




high degree disappointing’, said Lord Birkenhead, frankly, in the

British House of Lords on August 10.


What was the position on each side? Right was on our

side. World sympathy was on our side (passive sympathy, largely). We

had shown a mettle that was a fair indication of what we could do

again if freedom were denied us. We were united; we had taken out of

the hands of the enemy a good deal of government. We knew it would be

no easy matter for him to recover his lost ground in that regard. We

had prevented the enemy so far from defeating us.


We had not, however, succeeded in getting the government

entirely into our hands, and we had not succeeded in beating the

British out of Ireland, militarily.


We had unquestionably seriously interfered with their

government, and we had prevented them from conquering us. That was the

sum of our achievement.


We had reached in July last the high-water mark of what

we could do in the way of economic and military resistance.


The British had a bad case. World sympathy was not with

them. They had been oppressing us with murderous violence. At the same

time they preached elsewhere the new world doctrine of government by consent of the governed. They, too,

had reached their high-water mark. They had the power, the force, the

armament, to re-conquer us, but they hesitated to exercise that power

without getting a world mandate. But, though they had failed in their

present attempt, their troops were still in possession of our island.

At the time of the Truce they were, in fact, drafting additional and

huge levies into Ireland.




---

p.88


We had recognised our inability to beat the British out

of Ireland, and we recognised what that inability meant. Writing in

the weekly called The Republic of Ireland on 21st

February last, Mr. Barton, a former member of the Dáil Cabinet, stated, that, before the Truce

of July 11th it ‘had become plain that it was physically impossible

to secure Ireland's ideal of a completely isolated Republic otherwise

than by driving the overwhelmingly superior British forces out of the

country’.


we also recognised facts in regard to North-East

Ulster.We clearly recognised that our national view was not shared by

the majority in the four north-eastern counties. We knew that the

majority had refused to give allegiance to an Irish Republic.


Before we entered the Conference we realised these facts

among ourselves. We had abandoned, for the time being, the hope of

achieving the ideal of independence under the Republican form.


It is clear, that the British on their side knew that

unless we obtained a real, substantial freedom we would resist to the

end at no matter what cost. But they also knew that they could make a

generous settlement with us. They knew equally

well that an offer of such a settlement would disarm the world

criticism which could no longer be ignored. They knew they could do

these two major things and still preserve the nations of the British Commonwealth from violent

disruption.


The British believed (and still believe) that they need

not, and could not, acquiesce in secession by us, that they need not,

and could not, acquiesce in the


---

p.89




 establishment of a Republican government so close to their

own shores. This would be regarded by them as a challenge—a

defiance which would be a danger to the very safety of England

herself. It would be presented in this light to the people of England.

It would be represented as a disruption of the British Empire and

would form a headline for other places. South Africa would be the

first to follow our example and Britain's security and prestige would

be gone. The British spokesmen believed they dared not agree to such a

forcible breaking away. It would show not only their Empire to be

intolerable, but themselves feeble and futile.


Looking forward through the operation of world forces to

the development of freedom, it is certain that at some time

acquiescence in the ultimate separation of the units will come. The

American colonies of Britain got their freedom by a successful war.

Canada, South Africa, and the other States of the British Commonwealth

are approaching the same end by peaceful growth. In this Britain

acquiesces. Separation by peaceful stages of evolution does not expose

her and does not endanger her.


In judging the merits, in examining the details, of the

peace we brought back these factors must be taken into

consideration.


Before accepting the invitation sent by Mr. Lloyd George,

on behalf of his Cabinet, to a Conference, we endeavoured to get an

unfettered basis for that Conference. We did not succeed. It is true

we reasserted our claim that our Plenipotentiaries could only enter

such a Conference as the spokesmen of an independent Sovereign State.

It is equally true that this claim


---

p.90




 was tacitly admitted by Britain in inviting us to

negotiate at all, but the final phase was that we accepted the

invitation ‘to ascertain how the association of Ireland with the

group of nations known as the British Commonwealth may best be

reconciled with Irish national aspirations’.


The invitation opened up the questions, What is the

position of the nations forming the British Commonwealth, and how

could our national aspirations best be reconciled with associations

with those nations? Legally and obsoletely the nations of the

Commonwealth are in a position of subservience to Britain.

Constitutionally they occupy to- day a position of freedom and of

equality with their mother country.


Sir Robert Borden, in the Peace Treaty debate in the

Canadian House on September 2nd, 1919, claimed for Canada a

‘complete sovereignty’. This claim has never been challenged by

Britain. It has, in fact, been allowed by Mr. Bonar Law. General

Smuts, in a debate on the same subject in the Union House on September

10th, 1919, said: ‘We have secured a position of absolute equality

and freedom, not only among the other States of the Empire, but among

the other nations of the world’.


In other words, the former dependent Dominions of the

British Commonwealth are now free and secure in their freedom.


That position of freedom, and of freedom from

interference, we have secured in the Treaty. The Irish

Plenipotentiaries forced from the British Plenipotentiaries the

admission that our status in association with the British nations

would be the constitutional status of Canada.




---

p.91


The definition of that status is the bedrock of the

Treaty. It is the recognition of our right to freedom, and a freedom

which shall not be challenged.


No arrangements afterwards mentioned in the Treaty,

mutual arrangements agreed upon between our nation and the British

nation, can interfere with or derogate from the position which the

mention of that status gives us.


The Treaty is but the expression of the terms upon which

the British were willing to evacuate—the written recognition of

the freedom which such evacuation in itself secures.


We got in the Treaty the strongest guarantees of freedom

and security that we could have got on paper, the strongest guarantees

that we could have got in a Treaty between Great Britain and

ourselves. The most realistic demonstration of the amount of real

practical freedom acquired was the evacuation of the British troops

and the demobilisation of the military police force. In place of the

British troops we have our own army. In place of the Royal Irish

Constabulary we are organising our own Civic Guard—our own

People's Police Force.


These things are the things of substance; these things

are the safe and genuine proof that the status secured by the Treaty

is what we claim it to be. They are the plainest definition of our

independence; they are the clearest recognition of our national

rights. They give us the surest power to maintain both our

independence and rights.


It is the evacuation by the British which gives us our

freedom. The Treaty is the guarantee that that


---

p.92




 freedom shall not be violated. The States of the British

Commonwealth have the advantage over us of distance. They have the

security which that distance gives. They have their freedom. Whatever

their nominal position in relation to Britain may be, they can

maintain their freedom aided by their distance.


We have not the advantage of distance. Our nearness would

be a disadvantage to us under whatever form, and in whatever

circumstances, we had obtained our freedom (in case of a feeling of

hostility between the two countries, the nearness is, of course, more

than a disadvantage to us—it is a standing danger). It was the

task of the Plenipotentiaries to overcome this geographical condition

in so far as any written arrangement could overcome it.


We succeeded in securing a written recognition of our

status. The Treaty clauses covering this constitute a pledge that we

shall be as safe from interference as Canada is safe owing to the fact

of her four thousand miles of geographical separation.


Our immunity can never be challenged without challenging

the immunity of Canada. Having the same constitutional status as

Canada, a violation of our freedom would be a challenge to the freedom

of Canada. It gives a security which we ought not lightly to despise.

No such security would have been reached by the external association

aimed at in Document No. 2.


The Treaty is the signed agreement between Britain and

ourselves. It is the recognition of our freedom by Britain, and it is

the assurance that, having withdrawn her troops, Britain will not

again attempt to interfere with that freedom. The free nations of the


---

p.93




 Commonwealth are witnesses to Britain's signature.


The occupation of our ports for defensive purposes might

appear to be a challenge to our security. It is not. The naval

facilities are granted by us to Britain, and are accepted by her in

the Treaty as by one independent nation from another by international

agreement. For any purpose of interference with us these facilities

cannot be used.


At the best, these facilities are, the British say,

necessary for the protection of the arteries of their economic and

commercial life. At the worst, they are but the expression of the fact

that we are at present militarily weaker. Negotiations, therefore

treaties, are the expressions of adjustments, of agreements, between

two nations as to the terms on which one side will acquiesce in the

proposals of the other.


The arrangement provided in the Treaty in regard to

North-East Ulster is also but a matter of agreement between ourselves

and Britain. It is an agreement by us that we will deal with the

difficulty created by Britain. It is an assurance that we will give

the North-East certain facilities to enable them to take their place

willingly in the Irish Nation.


The maligned Treaty Oath was a further admission wrung

from Britain of the real relationship between the British nations.

Canada and South Africa continue to swear allegiance to King George,

his heirs, successors, etc. They give an oath in keeping with their

obsolete position of independence, but out of keeping with their

actual position of freedom. Mr. de Valera's alternative oath

recognised the King of England as head of the Association—a head

inferring subordinates. The


---

p.94




 Treaty Oath, however, expresses faithfulness only as

symbolical of that association, and is, therefore, really a

declaration that each party will be faithful to the compact.


The Irish Plenipotentiaries have been described as

‘incompetent amateurs’. They were, it is said, cajoled and

tricked by the wily and experienced British Prime Minister. By means

of the fight we put up in the war, by means of the fight we put up in

the negotiations, we got the British to evacuate our country. Not only

to evacuate it militarily, but to evacuate it socially and

economically as well. In addition, we got from the British a signed

undertaking to respect the freedom which these evacuations give

us.


We acquiesced, in return, to be associated with the

British Commonwealth of Nations for certain international purposes. We

granted to Britain certain naval facilities.


There is the bargain. It is for the Irish and for our

friends the world over to judge whether the ‘incompetent

amateurs’ who formed the Irish delegation of Plenipotentiaries

forgot their country in making it. If our national aspirations could

only have been expressed by the full Republican ideal, then they were

not, and never could be, reconciled with what was understood by

‘association with the group of nations known as the British

Empire’.


By accepting that invitation we agreed, however some may

now deceive themselves and attempt to deceive others, that we would

acquiesce in some association. In return for that acquiescence we

expected something tangible—evacuation, abandonment of


---

p.95




 British aggression. If we had been martially victorious

over Britain there would have been no question of such

acquiescence.


Now, if that is so, and it is so, the surrender of some

national sentiment was for the time unavoidable. The British Empire,

the British Commonwealth, or the British League of Free

Nations—it does not matter what name you call it—is what

it is. It is what it is, with all its trappings of feudalism, its

symbols of monarchy, its feudal phraseology, its obsolete oaths of

allegiance, its King a figurehead having no individual power as King,

maintaining the unhealthy atmosphere of mediaeval subservience

translated into modern snobbery. All this is doubly offensive to us,

offensive to our Gaelic instincts of social equality which recognises

only an aristocracy of the mind, and offensive from the memories of

hundreds of years of tyranny carried out in the name of the British

King.


Those who could not, or who would not, look these facts

in the face blame us now, and more than blame us. They find fault with

us that, in agreeing to some kind of association of our nation with

the British nations, we were not able, by the touch of a magic wand,

to get rid of all the language of Empire. That is not a fair attitude.

We like that language no more, perhaps less, than do those who wish to

make us responsible for its preservation. It is Britain's affair, not

ours, that she cares to preserve these prevarications.


Let us look to what we have undoubtedly gained and not to

what we might have gained. Let us see how the maximum value can be

realised from that gain. If we would only put away dreams, and face

realities,


---

p.96




 nearly all the things that count we have now for our

country.


What we want is that Ireland shall be Ireland in spirit

as well as in name. It is not any verbiage about sovereignty which can

assure our power to shape our destinies. It is to grasp everything

which is of benefit to us, to manage these things for ourselves, to

get rid of the unIrish atmosphere and influence, to make our

government and restore our national life on the lines which suit our

national character and our national requirements best. It is now only

fratricidal strife which can prevent us from making the Gaelic Ireland

which is our goal.


The test of the Government we want is whether it conforms

with Irish tradition and national character? Whether it will suit us

and enable us to live socially and prosper? Whether we can achieve

something which our old free Irish democratic life would have

developed into?


We have shaken off the foreign domination which prevented

us from living our own life in our own way. We are now free to do

this. It depends on ourselves alone whether we can do it.

DISTINCTIVE CULTURE
-------------------


### Ancient Irish Civiliation

#### Glories of the Past


It was not only by the British armed occupation that

Ireland was subdued. It was by means of the destruction, after great

effort, of our Gaelic civilization. This destruction brought upon us

the loss almost of nationality itself. For the last 100 years or more

Ireland has been a nation in little more than in name.


Britain wanted us for her own economic ends, as well as

to satisfy her love of conquest. It was found, however, that Ireland

was not an easy country to conquer, nor to use for the purposes for

which conquests are made. We had a native culture. We had a social

system of our own. We had an economic organisation. We had a code of

laws which fitted us.


These were such in their beauty, their honesty, their

recognition of right and justice, and in their strength, that

foreigners coming to our island brought with them nothing of like

attractiveness to replace them. These foreigners accepted Irish

civilization, forgot their own, and eagerly became absorbed into the

Irish race.




---

p.98


Ireland, unlike Britain, had never become a part of the

Roman Empire. Even if the Romans had invaded Ireland, and had been

able to get a foothold, it is not probable that they would have

succeeded in imposing their form of government. At that time our

native civilization had become well advanced. It had advanced far past

the primitive social state of the Britons and of other of the North

European peoples.


And it had, through its democratic basis, which would

have been strengthened and adapted as time went on, a health and

permanence which would have enabled it to withstand the rivalry of the

autocratic government of Rome, which always had in it the seeds of

decay.


The Romans invaded Britain and imposed their government

till it was destroyed by fresh invaders. And the history of England,

unlike the history of Ireland, was one in which each new invasion

altered the social polity of the people. Foreigners were not absorbed

as in Ireland. England was affected by every fresh incursion, and

English civilization to-day is the reflection of such changes.


The Roman armies did not come to Ireland. But Ireland was

known to the merchants of the Empire, who brought with them not only

commerce but art and culture. Ireland took from them what was of

advantage, and our civilization went on growing in strength and

harmony. It grew more and more to fit the Irish people, and became the

expression of them. It could never have been destroyed except by

deliberate uprooting aided by military violence.


The Irish social and economic system was democratic.


---

p.99




 It was simple and harmonious. The people had security in

their rights, and just law. And, suited to them, their economic life

progressed smoothly. Our people had leisure for the things in which

they took delight. They had leisure for the cultivation of the mind,

by the study of art, literature, and the traditions. They developed

character and bodily strength by acquiring skill in military exercise

and in the national games.


The pertinacity of Irish civilization was due to the

democratic basis of its economic system, and the aristocracy of its

culture.


It was the reverse of Roman civilization in which the

State was held together by a central authority, controlling and

defending it, the people being left to themselves in all social and

intellectual matters. Highly organised, Roman civilization was

powerful, especially for subduing and dominating other races, for a

time. But not being rooted in the interests and respect of the people

themselves, it could not survive.


Gaelic civilization was quite different. The people of

the whole nation were united, not by material forces, but by spiritual

ones. Their unity was not of any military solidarity. It came from

sharing the same traditions. It came from honouring the same heroes,

from inheriting the same literature, from willing obedience to the

same law, the law which was their own law and reverenced by them.


They never exalted a central authority. Economically they

were divided up into a number of larger and smaller units. Spiritually

and socially they were one people.




---

p.100


Each community was independent and complete within its

own boundaries. The land belonged to the people. It was held for the

people by the Chief of the Clan. He was their trustee. He secured his

position by the will of the people only. His successor was elected by

the people.


The privileges and duties of the chiefs, doctors,

lawyers, bards, were the same throughout the country. The schools were

linked together in a national system. The bards and historians

travelled from one community to another. The schools for the study of

law, medicine, history, military skill, belonged to the whole nation,

and were frequented by those who were chosen by each community to be

their scholars.


The love of learning and of military skill was the

tradition of the whole people. They honoured not kings nor chiefs as

kings and chiefs, but their heroes and their great men. Their men of

high learning ranked with the kings and sat beside them in equality at

the high table.


It was customary for all the people to assemble together

on fixed occasions to hear the law expounded and the old heroic tales

recited. The people themselves contributed. They competed with each

other in the games. These assemblies were the expression of our Irish

civilization and one of the means by which it was preserved.


Thus Ireland was a country made up of a large number of

economically independent units. But in the things of the mind and

spirit the nation was one.


This democratic social polity, with the exaltation of the

things of the mind and character, are the essence


---

p.101




 of ancient Irish civilization, and must provide the

keynote for the new.


It suited our character and genius. While we were able to

preserve it no outside enemy had any power against us. While it

survived our subjection was impossible. But our invaders learned its

strength and set out to destroy it.


English civilization, while it may suit the English

people, could only be alien to us. It is English civilization,

fashioned out of their history. For us it is a misfit. It is a

garment, not something within us. We are mean, clumsy, and ungraceful,

wearing it. It exposes all our defects while giving us no scope to

display our good qualities. Our external and internal life has become

the expression of its unfitness. The Gaelic soul of the Irish people

still lives. In itself it is indestructible. But its qualities are

hidden, besmirched, by that which has been imposed upon us, just as

the fine, splendid surface of Ireland is besmirched by our towns and

villages—hideous medleys of contemptible dwellings and mean

shops and squalid public-houses, not as they should be in material

fitness, the beautiful human expressions of what our God-given country

is.


It is only in the remote corners of Ireland in the South

and West and North-West that any trace of the old Irish civilization

is met with now. To those places the social side of anglicisation was

never able very easily to penetrate. To-day it is only in those places

that any native beauty and grace in Irish life survive. And these are

the poorest parts of our country!


In the island of Achill, impoverished as the people are,

hard as their lives are, difficult as the struggle for


---

p.102




 existence is, the outward aspect is a pageant. One may

see processions of young women riding down on the island ponies to

collect sand from the seashore, or gathering in the turf, dressed in

their shawls and in their brilliantly-coloured skirts made of material

spun, woven, and dyed, by themselves, as it has been spun, woven, and

dyed, for over a thousand years. Their cottages also are little

changed. They remain simple and picturesque. It is only in such places

that one gets a glimpse of what Ireland may become again, when the

beauty may be something more than a pageant, will be the outward sign

of a prosperous and happy Gaelic life.


Our internal life too has become the expression of the

misfit of English civilization. With all their natural intelligence,

the horizon of many of our people has become bounded by the daily

newspaper, the public-house, and the racecourse. English civilization

made us into the stage Irishman, hardly a caricature.


They destroyed our language, all but destroyed it, and in

giving us their own they cursed us so that we have become its slaves.

Its words seem with us almost an end in themselves, and not as they

should be, the medium for expressing our thoughts.


We have now won the first victory. We have secured the

departure of the enemy who imposed upon us that by which we were

debased, and by means of which he kept us in subjection. We only

succeeded after we had begun to get back our Irish ways, after we had

made a serious effort to speak our own language, after we had striven

again to govern ourselves. We can only keep out the enemy, and all

other enemies, by completing that task.




---

p.103


We are now free in name. The extent to which we become

free in fact and secure our freedom will be the extent to which we

become Gaels again. It is a hard task. The machine of the British

armed force, which tried to crush us, we could see with our physical

eyes. We could touch it. We could put our physical strength against

it. We could see their agents in uniform and under arms. We could see

their tanks and armoured cars.


But the spiritual machine which has been mutilating us,

destroying our customs, and our independent life, is not so easy to

discern. We have to seek it out with the eyes of our mind. We have to

put against it the whole weight of our united spiritual strength. And

it has become so familiar, how are we to recognise it?


We cannot, perhaps. But we can do something else. We can

replace it. We can fill our minds with Gaelic ideas, and our lives

with Gaelic customs, until there is no room for any other.


It is not any international association of our nation

with the British nations which is going to hinder us in that task. It

lies in our own hands. Upon us will rest the praise or blame of the

real freedom we make for ourselves or the absence of it.


The survival of some connection with our former enemy,

since it has no power to chain us, should act as a useful irritant. It

should be a continual reminder of how near we came to being, indeed, a

British nation. No one now has any power to make us that but ourselves

alone.


We have to build up a new civilization on the foundations

of the old. And it is not the leaders of the Irish


---

p.104




 people who can do it for the people. They can but point

the way. They can but do their best to establish a reign of justice

and of law and order which will enable the people to do it for

themselves.


It is not to political leaders our people must look, but

to themselves. Leaders are but individuals, and individuals are

imperfect, liable to error and weakness. The strength of the nation

will be the strength of the spirit of the whole people. We must have a

political, economic, and social system in accordance with our national

character.


It must be a system in which our material, intellectual,

and spiritual needs and tastes will find expression and satisfaction.

We shall then grow to be in ourselves and in what we produce, and in

the villages, towns, and cities in which we live, and in our homes, an

expression of the light which is within us, as now we are in nearly

all those things an indication of the darkness which has enveloped us

for so long.


Economically we must be democratic, as in the past. The

right of all the people must be secure. The people must become again

‘the guardians of their law and of their land’. Each must be free

to reap the full reward of his labour. Monopoly must not be allowed to

deprive anyone of that right.


Neither, through the existence of monopoly, must capital

be allowed to be an evil. It must not be allowed to draw away all the

fruits of labour to itself. It must fulfil its proper function of

being the means by which are brought forth fresh and fuller fruits for

the benefit of all.


With real democracy in our economic life, country

districts would become again living centres. The


---

p.105




 people would again be co-operating in industry, and

co-operating and competing in pleasure and in culture. Our

countrysides would cease to be the torpid deserts they are now, giving

the means of existence and nothing more.


Our Government must be democratic in more than in name.

It must be the expression of the people's wishes. It must carry out

for them all, and only, what is needed to be done for the people as a

whole. It must not interfere with what the people can do for

themselves in their own centres. We must not have State Departments

headed by a politician whose only qualification is that he has climbed

to a certain rung in the political ladder.


The biggest task will be the restoration of the language.

How can we express our most subtle thoughts and finest feelings in a

foreign tongue? Irish will scarcely be our language in this

generation, not even perhaps in the next. But until we have it again

on our tongues and in our minds we are not free, and we will produce

no immortal literature.


Our music and our art and literature must be in the lives

of the people themselves, not as in England, the luxury of the few.

England has produced some historians, many great poets, and a few

great artists, but they are the treasures of the cultured minority and

have no place in the lives of the main body of the English people.


Our poets and artists will be inspired in the stimulating

air of freedom to be something more than the mere producers of verse

and painters of pictures. They will tea ch us, by their vision, the

noble race we


---

p.106


 may become, expressed in their poetry and

their

pictures. They will inspire us to live as Irish men and Irish women

should. They have to show us the way, and the people will then in

their turn become the inspiration of the poets and artists of the

future Gaelic Ireland.


Our civilization will be glorious or the reverse,

according to the character of the people. And the work we produce will

be the expression of what we are. Our external life has become the

expression of all we have been deprived of—something shapeless,

ugly, without native life. But the spark of native life is still there

and can be fanned into flame.


What we have before us is the great work of building up

our nation. No soft road—a hard road, but inspiring and

exalting. Irish art and Irish customs must be revived, and must be

carried out by the people themselves, helped by a central Government,

not controlled and managed by it; helped by departments of music, art,

national painting, etc., with local centres connected with them.


The commercialising of these things—art,

literature, music, the drama—as is done in other countries, must

be discouraged. Everybody being able to contribute, we would have a

skilled audience, criticising and appreciating, and not only, as in

England, paying for seats to hear famous performers, but for real

appreciative enjoyment and education.


Our national education must provide a balance of the

competing elements—the real education of the faculties, and

storing the mind with the best thoughts of the great men of our own

and other nations. And


---

p.107




 there must be education by special training for trades

and professions for the purpose of scientific eminence in medicine,

law, agriculture, and commerce.


And, as fit habitations for healthy minds, we must have

healthy bodies. We shall have these by becoming again skilled in

military prowess and skilled in our Gaelic games, which develop

strength and nerve and muscle. They teach us resource, courage, and

co-operation. These games provide for our civil life those qualities

of ingenuity and daring which military training teaches for the

purposes of war.


Our army, if it exists for honourable purposes only, will

draw to it honourable men. It will call to it the best men of our

race—men of skill and culture. It will not be recruited as so

many modern armies are, from those who are industrially useless.


This will certainly be so, for our army will only exist

for the defence of our liberties, and of our people in the exercise of

their liberties. An Irish army can never be used for the ignoble

purpose of invasion, subjugation, and exploitation.


But it is not only upon our army that our security will

depend. It will depend more upon the extent to which we make ourselves

invulnerable by having a civilization which is indestructible. That

civilization will only be indestructible by being enthroned in the

lives of the people, and having its foundation resting on right,

honesty, and justice.


Our army will be but secondary in maintaining our

security. Its strength will be but the strength of real

resistance—the extent to which we build up within ourselves what

can never be invaded and what can


---

p.108




 never be destroyed—the extent to which we make

strong the spirit of the Irish Nation.


We are a small nation. Our military strength in

proportion to the mighty armaments of modern nations can never be

considerable. Our strength as a nation will depend upon our economic

freedom, and upon our moral and intellectual force. In these we can

become a shining light in the world.

BUILDING UP IRELAND
-------------------


### Resources to be Developed


Mr. de Valera, in a speech he made on February 19, warned

the people of Ireland against a life of ease, against living

practically ‘the life of the beasts’, which, he fears, they may

be tempted to do in Ireland under the Free State.


The chance that materialism will take possession of the

Irish people is no more likely in a free Ireland under the Free State

than it would be in a free Ireland under a Republican or any other

form of government. It is in the hands of the Irish people

themselves.


In the ancient days of Gaelic civilization the people

were prosperous and they were not materialists. They were one of the

most spiritual and one of the most intellectual peoples in Europe.

When Ireland was swept by destitution and famine the spirit of the

Irish people came most nearly to extinction. It was with the improved

economic conditions of the last twenty years or more that it has

reawakened. The insistent needs of the body more adequately satisfied,

the people regained desire once more to reach out to the higher things

in which the spirit finds its satisfaction.




---

p.110


What we hope for in the new Ireland is to have such

material welfare as will give the Irish spirit that freedom. We want

such widely diffused prosperity that the Irish people will not be

crushed by destitution into living practically ‘the lives of the

beasts’.


They were so crushed during the British occupation that

they were described as being ‘without the comforts of an English

sow’. Neither must they be obliged, owing to unsound economic

conditions, to spend all their powers of both mind and body in an

effort to satisfy the bodily needs alone. The uses of wealth are to

provide good health, comfort, moderate luxury, and to give the freedom

which comes from the possession of these things.


Our object in building up the country economically must

not be lost sight of. That object is not to be able to boast of

enormous wealth or of a great volume of trade, for their own sake. It

is not to see our country covered with smoking chimneys and factories.

It is not to show a great national balance-sheet, nor to point to a

people producing wealth with the self-obliteration of a hive of

bees.


The real riches of the Irish nation will be the men and

women of the Irish nation, the extent to which they are rich in body

and mind and character.


What we want is the opportunity for everyone to be able

to produce sufficient wealth to ensure these advantages for

themselves. That such wealth can be produced in Ireland there can be

no doubt: ‘For the island is so endowed with so many dowries of

nature, considering the fruitfulness of the soil, the ports, the

rivers, the fishings, and especially the race 


---

p.111


 and

generation of men, valiant, hard, and active, as it is not easy to

find such a confluence of commodities’. Such was the impression

made upon a visitor who came long ago to our island. We have now the

opportunities to make our land indeed fruitful, to work up our natural

resources, to bring prosperity for all our people.


If our national economy is put on a sound footing from

the beginning it will, in the new Ireland, be possible for our people

to provide themselves with the ordinary requirements of decent living.

It will be possible for each to have sufficient food, a good home in

which to live in fair comfort and contentment. We shall be able to

give our children bodily and mental health; and our people will be

able to secure themselves against the inevitable times of sickness and

old age.


That must be our object. What we must aim at is the

building up of a sound economic life in which great discrepancies

cannot occur. We must not have the destitution of poverty at one end,

and at the other an excess of riches in the possession of a few

individuals, beyond what they can spend with satisfaction and

justification.


Millionaires can spend their surplus wealth bestowing

libraries broadcast upon the world. But who will say that the benefits

accruing could compare with those arising from a condition of things

in which the people themselves everywhere, in the city, town, and

village, were prosperous enough to buy their own books and to put

together their own local libraries in which they could take a personal


---

p.112




 interest and acquire knowledge in proportion to that

interest?


The growing wealth of Ireland will, we hope, be diffused

through all our people, all sharing in the growing prosperity, each

receiving according to what each contributes in the making of that

prosperity, so that the weal of all is assured.


How are we to increase the wealth of Ireland and ensure

that all producing it shall share in it? That is the question which

will be engaging the minds of our people, and will engage the

attention of the new Government.


The keynote to the economic revival must be development

of Irish resources by Irish capital for the benefit of the Irish

consumer in such a way that the people have steady work at just

remuneration and their own share of control.


How are we to develop Irish resources? The earth is our

bountiful mother. Upon free access to it depends not only agriculture,

but all other trades and industries. Land must be freely available.

Agriculture, our main industry, must be improved and developed. Our

existing industries must be given opportunities to expand. Conditions

must be created which will make it possible for new ones to arise.

Means of transit must be extended and cheapened. Our harbours must be

developed. Our water-power must be utilised; our mineral resources

must be exploited.


Foreign trade must be stimulated by making facilities for

the transport and marketing of Irish goods abroad and foreign goods in

Ireland. Investors must be urged and encouraged to invest Irish

capital in


---

p.113




 Irish concerns. Taxation, where it hinders, must be

adjusted, and must be imposed where the burden will fall lightest and

can best be borne, and where it will encourage rather than discourage

industry.


We have now in Ireland, owing to the restrictions put

upon emigration during the European war, a larger population of young

men and women than we have had for a great many years. For their own

sake and to maintain the strength of the nation room must and can be

found for them.


Agriculture is, and is likely to continue to be, our

chief source of wealth. If room is to be found for our growing

population, land must be freely available. Land is not freely

available in Ireland. Thousands of acres of the best land lie idle or

are occupied as ranches or form part of extensive private estates.


Side by side with this condition there are thousands of

our people who are unable to get land on which to keep a cow or even

to provide themselves and their families with vegetables.


If the ranches can be broken up, if we can get the land

back again into the hands of our people, there will be plenty of

employment and a great increase in the national wealth.


If land could be obtained more cheaply in town and

country the housing problem would not present so acute a problem.

There are large areas unoccupied in towns and cities as well as in

country districts. When the Convention sat in 1917 it was found that

in urban areas alone, 67,000 houses were urgently needed. The figure

must at the present moment be considerably higher. To ease the


---

p.114




 immediate situation, the Provisional Government has

announced a grant to enable a considerable number of houses to be

built. This grant, although seemingly large, is simply a recognition

of the existence of the problem.


For those who intend to engage in agriculture we require

specialised education. Agriculture is in these days a highly technical

industry. We have the experiences of countries like Holland, Germany,

Denmark to guide us. Scientific methods of farming and stock-raising

must be introduced. We must have the study of specialised chemistry to

aid us, as it does our foreign competitors in the countries I have

named. We must establish industries arising directly out of

agriculture, industries for the utilisation of the by-products of the

land—bones, bristles, hides for the production of soda glue, and

other valuable substances.


With plenty of land available at an economic rent or

price such industries can be established throughout the country

districts, opening up new opportunities for employment.


Up to the sixteenth century Ireland possessed a colonial

trade equal to England's. It was destroyed by the jealousy of English

ship- owners and manufacturers, and, by means of the Navigation Laws,

England swept Ireland's commerce off the seas. It is true that these

Navigation Laws were afterwards removed. But the removal found the

Irish capital which might have restored our ruined commerce drained

away from the country by the absence of opportunities for utilising

it, or by absentee landlordism, or in other ways.




---

p.115


The development of industry in the new Ireland should be

on lines which exclude monopoly profits. The product of industry would

thus be left sufficiently free to supply good wages to those employed

in it. The system should be on co-operative lines rather than on the

old commercial capitalistic lines of the huge joint stock companies.

At the same time I think we shall safely avoid State Socialism, which

has nothing to commend it in a country like Ireland, and, in any case,

is monopoly of another kind.


Given favourable conditions, there is a successful future

for dressed meat industries on the lines of the huge co-operative

industry started in Wexford; while there are many opportunities for

the extension of dairying and cheese-making.


The industries we possess are nearly all capable of

expansion. We can improve and extend all the following:

1. Brewing and distilling.
2. Manufacture of tobacco.
3. Woollen and linen industry.
4. Manufacture of hosiery and underclothing.
5. Rope and twine industry.
6. Manufacture of boots and shoes, saddlery, and all

kinds of leather articles.
7. Production of hardware and agricultural

machinery.
8. Production and curing of fish.



Of manufactured articles £48,000,000 worth are

imported into Ireland yearly. A large part of these could be produced

more economically at home. If


---

p.116




 land were procurable abundantly and cheaply it would be

necessary also that capital should be forthcoming to get suitable

sites for factories, a more easily obtained supply of power, an

improvement, increase, and cheapening of the means of transport.


There are facilities for producing an enormous variety of

products both for the home and foreign markets, if factories could be

established. These should, as far as possible, be dispersed about the

country instead of being concentrated in a few areas. This disposal

will not only have the effect of avoiding congestion, but will

incidentally improve the status and earnings of the country population

and will enlarge their horizon.


I am not advocating the establishment of an industrial

system as other countries know industrialism. If we are to survive as

a distinct and free nation, industrial development must be on the

general lines I am following. Whatever our solution of the question

may be, we all realise that the industrial status

quo is imperfect. However we may differ in outlook, politically

or socially, it is recognised that one of the most pressing

needs—if not the most pressing—is the question of labour

in relation to industry, and it is consequently vitally necessary for

the development of our resources that the position of employers and

employees should rest on the best possible foundation.


And with this question of labour and industry is

interwoven the question of land. It is no less important to have our

foundations secure here. In the development of Ireland the land

question presents itself under four main headings:


---

p.117


1. The completion of purchase of tenanted

lands;
2. The extension and increase of powers of

purchase of untenanted lands;
3. The question of congestion in rural

districts;
4. The utilisation of lands unoccupied or

withheld in urban areas.



For the purpose of such development Ireland has three

great natural resources. Our coal deposits are by no means

inconsiderable. The bogs of Ireland are estimated as having 500,000

million tons of peat fuel. Water-power is concentrated in her 237

rivers and 180 lakes. The huge Lough Corrib system could be utilised,

for instance, to work the granite in the neighbourhood of Galway. In

the opinion of experts, reporting to the Committee on the Water-Power

Resources of Ireland, from the Irish lakes and rivers a total of

500,000 h.p. is capable of being developed.


The magnitude of this is more readily seen if it is

appreciated that to raise this power in steam would require 7,500,000

tons of coal. With the present price of coal it should be a commercial

proposition to develop our water-power as against steam, even though

it did not take the place of steam-power entirely.


Schemes have been worked out to utilise the water-power

of the Shannon, the Erne, the Bann, and the Liffey. It is probable

that the Liffey and the Bann, being closely connected with industrial

centres, can be dealt with at once. With unified control


---

p.118




 and direction, various sources of water-power could be

arranged in large stations for centralised industries, and the energy

could be redistributed to provide light and heat for the neighbouring

towns and villages.


That the advantages of our water-power are not lost on

some of the keenest minds of the day is shown by the following extract

from a speech made by Lord Northcliffe on St. Patrick's Day, 1917:


The growth of the population of Great Britain has been

largely due to manufactures based on the great asset, black coal.

Ireland has none of the coal which has made England rich, but she

possesses in her mighty rivers white coal of which millions of

horse-power are being lost to Ireland every year [*gap: ellipsis*] I can see in the

future very plainly prosperous cities, old and new, fed by the

greatest river in the United Kingdom—the Shannon. I should like

to read recent experts' reports on the Moy, the Suir, and the Lee.


The development of this white power will also enable the

means of communication and transport by rail and road to be cheapened

and extended. And there is an urgent need for cheap transit. Railway

rates and shipping rates are so high that, to take one example, the

cost of transit is prohibitive to the Irish fish trade.


While the Irish seas are teeming with fish, we have the

Dublin market depending upon the English market for its supplies. The

export of Irish fish is decreasing, and the fishing industry is

neither the source of remuneration it should be to those engaged in

it, nor the source of profit it could be to the country.




---

p.119


To facilitate the transport of agricultural produce and

commodities generally, a complete system of ways of communication must

be established. The extension and unifying of our railways, linking up

ocean ports and fishing harbours with the interior, is essential. This

system will be worked in connection with our inland waterways, and

will be supplemented by a motor-lorry service on our roads—and

these also must be greatly improved.


Our harbours must be developed. Ireland occupies a unique

geographical position. She is the stepping-stone between the Old World

and the New. She should therefore, become a great exchange mart

between Europe and America. With Galway harbour improved and developed

so as to receive American liners, passengers could land in Europe one

or two days earlier than by disembarking at Liverpool.


The port and docks of Dublin are already making

arrangements for a great increase in the volume of trade which is

expected with the establishment of an Irish Government in Dublin. They

are improving the port. They have schemes for providing deep water

berthage for the largest ships afloat.


Soon the port of Dublin will be fitted in every way to

receive and deal with all the trade which may be expected with our

growing prosperity. The Board is also reclaiming land at the mouth of

the Liffey, and soon some sixty acres will be available as a building

site. This land is splendidly situated for commercial purposes.


It will be important to create efficient machinery for

the economic marketing of Irish goods. A first step


---

p.120




 in this direction is the establishment of a clearing

house in Dublin or the most convenient centre. It would form a link

between a network of channels throughout Ireland through which goods

could be transmitted, connecting with another network reaching out to

all our markets abroad. It would examine and take delivery of goods

going out and coming in, dealing with the financial business for both

sides.


Such a concern would require capital and able and

experienced management. With such, its success should be assured. It

would be invaluable in helping our home and foreign trade. And with

improved means of transit in Ireland, and an increase in the number of

direct shipping routes, facilities would be in existence to make it

operate successfully. It is not difficult to see the advantages of

such a house. On the one hand it would be closely associated in

location and business working with a central railway station where the

important trunk lines converged, and on the other conveniently

situated in relation to the National Customs House.


The mineral resources of Ireland have never been properly

tapped. An Irish Government will not neglect this important source of

wealth. The development of mines and minerals will be on national

lines, and under national direction. This will prevent the monopoly by

private individuals of what are purely national resources belonging to

all the people of the nation. The profits from all these national

enterprises—the working of mines, development of water-power,

etc.—will belong to the nation for the advantage of the whole

nation.




---

p.121


But Irish men and women as private individuals must do

their share to increase the prosperity of the country. Business cannot

succeed without capital. Millions of Irish money are lying idle in

banks. The deposits in Irish joint stock banks increased in the

aggregate by £7,318,000 during the half-year ended December 31, 1921. At that date the total

of deposits and cash balances in the Irish banks was

£194,391,000, to which in addition there was a sum of almost

£14,000,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank. If Irish money were

invested in Irish industries, to assist existing ones, and to finance

new enterprises, there would be an enormous development of Irish

commerce.


The Irish people have a large amount of capital invested

abroad. With scope for our energies, with restoration of confidence,

the inevitable tendency will be towards return of this capital to

Ireland. It will then flow in its proper channel. It will be used for

opening up new and promising fields in this country. Ireland will

provide splendid opportunities for the investment of Irish capital,

and it is for the Irish people to take advantage of these

opportunities.


If they do not, investors and exploiters from outside

will come in to reap the rich profits which are to be made. And, what

is worse still, they will bring with them all the evils that we want

to avoid in the new Ireland.


We shall hope to see in Ireland industrial conciliation

and arbitration taking the place of strikes, and the workers sharing

in the ownership and management of businesses.




---

p.122


A prosperous Ireland will mean a united Ireland. With

equitable taxation and flourishing trade our North-East countrymen

will need no persuasion to come in and share in the healthy economic

life of the country.

FREEDOM WITHIN OUR GRASP
------------------------


### For Ourselves to Achieve It

#### Work of Gaelic League and Sinn Féin


The freedom which has been won is the fruit of the

national efforts of this generation and of preceding ones, and to

judge the merits of that fruit it is necessary to recall those

efforts. It is necessary to look back, and to see each one arising out

of each loss which the nation sustained.


We see them working along their separate but converging

lines—some mere trickling streams, others broad tributaries, but

all which had sufficient strength and right direction reaching,

becoming merged in, and swelling the volume of the river which flows

on to freedom.


Up to the Union English interference in Ireland had

succeeded only in its military and economic oppression. The national

spirit survived. The country had been disarmed after the Treaty of

Limerick. The land of Ireland had been confiscated. Native industry

and commerce were attacked and had been crippled or destroyed, but

Gaelic nationality lived on. The people spoke their own language,

preserved their Gaelic customs and ways of life, and remained united

in their common


---

p.124




 traditions. They had no inducement to look outside their

own country, and entrenched behind their language and their national

traditions, they kept their social life intact. Ireland was still the

Ireland of the wholly distinctive Irish people.


The efforts of resistance made by the nation were the

expressions of what had been robbed from the nation. There were

military uprisings to resist some new oppression, but these were also

the unconscious protests of a nation's right to defend itself by force

of arms. There were also peaceful attempts to recover economic, or

political, or religious freedom through the Parliament in Dublin.


With the Union came upheaval. The scene of government was

transferred to England. The garrison which was becoming Gaelicised

towards the end of the eighteenth century, turned away from Ireland

with the destruction of the Dublin Parliament, and made London their

Capital.


With Catholic Emancipation and the right to have representatives of the Irish people

to sit in the foreign parliament, the national spirit was at last

invaded. People began to look abroad. The anglicisation of Ireland had

begun.


The English language became the language of education and

fashion. It penetrated slowly at first. It was aided by the National

Schools. In those schools it was the only medium of education for a

people who were still Gaelic-speaking.


Side by side with this peaceful penetration, the Irish

language decayed, and when the people had adopted a new language and

had come to look to England


---

p.125




 for Government, they learned to see in English customs

and English culture the models upon which to fashion their own.


The gifts wrung for Ireland

(always wrung by agitation more or less violent in Ireland itself, and

never as a result of the oratory of the Irish representatives in the

British Parliament), Catholic Emancipation, Land Acts, Local

Government, where not actually destructive in themselves of the Gaelic

social economic system, helped in the denationalisation process.


These things undoubtedly brought ameliorative changes,

but the people got into the habit of looking to a foreign authority,

and they inevitably came to lose their self-respect, their

self-reliance, and their national strength.


The system made them forget to look to themselves, and

taught them to turn their backs upon their own country. We became the

beggars of the rich neighbours who had robbed us. We lost reverence

for our own nation, and we came very near to losing our national

identity.


O'Connell was the product of the Ireland which arose out

of this perversion. Prompted by the Young Irelanders, and urged on by

the zeal of the people, stirred for the moment to national

consciousness by the teaching of Davis, he talked of national liberty,

but he did nothing to win it. He was a follower and not a leader of

the people. He feared any movement of a revolutionary nature. Himself

a Gaelic speaker, he adopted the English language, so little did he

understand the strength to the nation of its own native language. His


---

p.126




 aim was little more than to see the Irish people a free

Catholic community.


He would have Ireland merely a prosperous province of

Britain with no national distinctiveness. Generally speaking, he

acquiesced in a situation which was bringing upon the Irish nation

spiritual decay.


The Young Irelanders, of whom Thomas Davis was the

inspiration, were the real leaders.


They saw and felt more deeply and aimed more truly. Davis

spoke to the soul of the sleeping nation— drunk with the waters

of forgetfulness. He sought to unite the whole people. He fought

against sectarianism and all the other causes which divided them.


He saw that unless we were Gaels we were not a nation.

When he thought of the nation he thought of the men and women of the

nation. He knew that unless they were free, Ireland could not be free,

and to fill them again with pride in their nation he sang to them of

the old splendour of Ireland, of their heroes, of their language, of

the strength of unity, of the glory of noble strife, of the beauties

of the land, of the delights and richness of the Gaelic life.


‘A nationality founded in the hearts and intelligence

of the people,’ he said, ‘would bid defiance to the arms of the

foe and guile of the traitor. The first step to nationality is the

open and deliberate recognition of it by the people themselves. Once

the Irish people declare the disconnection of themselves, their

feelings, and interests from the men, feelings, and interests of

England, they are in march for freedom’.


That was the true National Gospel. ‘Educate that you

may be free’, he said. ‘It was only by baptism at 


---

p.127




the fount of Gaelicism that we would get the strength and ardour to

fit us for freedom’.


The spirit of Davis breathed again in those who succeeded

to his teaching, and who, directed by that inspiration, kept the

footsteps of the nation on the right road for the march to

freedom.


The Union was accompanied by both economic and national

decay, and the movements of the nineteenth century were the outcome of

those two evils.


But one was more a political than a national movement,

unconscious of, or indifferent to, the fact that the nation was

rapidly dying. Its policy was to concentrate on England and agitate

for measures of reform and political emancipation. It was pleading to

the spoilers for a portion of the spoils they had robbed from us.


But those who had succeeded to the teachings of Davis saw

that if we continued to turn to England the nation would become

extinct. We were tacitly accepting England's denial of our nationhood

so useful for her propaganda purposes. We were selling our birthright

for a mess of pottage.


They saw that the nation could only be preserved and

freedom won by the Irish people themselves. We needed to become strong

within our nation individually as the self-respecting, self-reliant

men and women of the Irish nation; otherwise, we would never get into

the ‘march for freedom’.


The new movements were distinct, yet harmonious. They

were all built on the same foundation— the necessity for

national freedom. They all taught that the people must look to

themselves for economic


---

p.128




 prosperity, and must turn to national culture as a means

to national freedom.


They reached out to every phase of the people's lives,

educating to make them free. No means were too slight to use for that

purpose. The Gaelic Athletic Association reminded Irish boys that they

were Gaels. It provided and restored national games as an alternative

to the slavish adoption of English sport.


The Gaelic League restored the language to its place in

the reverence of the people. It revived Gaelic culture. While being

non- political, it was by its very nature intensely national. Within

its folds were nurtured the men and women who were to win for Ireland

the power to achieve national freedom. Irish history will recognise in

the birth of the Gaelic League in 1893 the most important event of the

nineteenth century. I may go further and say, not only the nineteenth

century, but in the whole history of our nation. It checked the

peaceful penetration and once and for all turned the minds of the

Irish people back to their own country. It did more than any other

movement to restore the national pride, honour, and self-respect.

Through the medium of the language it linked the people with the past

and led them to look to a future which would be a noble continuation

of it.


The Sinn Féin movement was both economic and

national, meeting, therefore, the two evils produced by the Union.

Inspired by Arthur Griffith and William Rooney, it grew to wield

enormous educational and spiritual power. It organised the country. It

promoted what came to be known as the ‘Irish-Ireland Policy’. It

preached the recreation of Ireland built upon the


---

p.129




 Gael. It penetrated into Belfast and North-East Ulster,

and was doing encouraging educational work, and was making the

national revival general when the World War broke out in 1914.


If that work could have been completed, the freedom which

has been won would have been completed. Until Ireland can speak to the

world with a united distinctive voice, we shall not have earned, and

shall not get, that full freedom in all its completeness which

nations, that are nations, can never rest until they have

achieved.


The Sinn Féin movement was not militant, but the

militant movement existed within it, and by its side. It had for its

advocates the two mightiest figures that have appeared in the whole

present movement—Tom Clarke and Seán MacDermott.


The two movements worked in perfect harmony.


Rooney preached language and liberty. He inspired all

whom he met with national pride and courage. ‘Tell the world bravely

what we seek’, he said. ‘We must be men if we mean to win’. He

believed that liberty could not be won unless we were fit and willing

to win it, and were ready to suffer and die for it.


He interpreted the national ideal as ‘an Irish State

governed by Irishmen for the benefit of the Irish people’. He

sought to impregnate the whole people with ‘a Gaelic-speaking

Nationality’. ‘Only then could we win freedom and be worthy of

it; freedom—individual and national freedom—of the fullest

and broadest character; freedom to think and act as it best beseems;

national freedom to stand equally with the rest of the world’.




---

p.130


He aimed at weaving Gaelicism into the whole fabric of

our national life. He wished to have Gaelic songs sung by the children

in the schools. He advocated the boycotting of English goods, always

with an eye to the spiritual effect. ‘We shall need to turn our

towns into something more than mere huxters' shops, and as a natural

consequence wells of anglicisation poisoning every section of our

people’.


Only by developing our own resources, by linking up our

life with the past, and adopting the civilization which was stopped by

the Union could we become Gaels again, and help to win our nation

back. As long as we were Gaels, he said, the influence of the

foreigner was negligible in Ireland. Unless we were Gaels we had no

claim to occupy a definite or distinct place in the world's life.


‘We most decidedly do believe that this nation has a

right to direct its own destinies. We do most heartily concede that

men bred and native of the soil are the best judges of what is good

for this land. We are believers in an Irish nation using its own

tongue, flying its own flag, defending its own coasts, and using its

own discretion when dealing with the outside world. But this we most

certainly believe can never come as the gift of any parliament,

British or otherwise; it can only be won by the strong right arm and

grim resolve of men’. ‘Neglect no weapon,’ he urged, ‘which

the necessities and difficulties of the enemy force him to abandon to

us, and make each concessiona stepping-stone to

further things’.


Rooney spoke as a prophet. He prepared the way and

foresaw the victory, and he helped his nation to

 rise, and, by developing its soul, to get ready for

victory.


A good tree brings forth good fruit—a barren one

produces nothing. The policy represented by O'Connell, Isaac Butt, and

John Redmond ended in impotence.


The freedom which Ireland has achieved was dreamed of by

Wolfe Tone, was foreseen by Thomas Davis, and their efforts were

broadened out until they took into their embrace all the true national

movements by the ‘grim resolve’ of William Rooney, supported

later by the ‘strong right arm’ of the Volunteers.


All the streams—economic, political, spiritual,

cultural, and militant—met together in the struggle of 1916-21

which has ended in a Peace, in which the Treaty of Limerick is wiped

out by the departure of the British armed forces, and the

establishment of an Irish Army in their place. In which the Union is

wiped out by the establishment of a free native Parliament which will

be erected on a Constitution expressing the will of the Irish

people.


With the Union came national enslavement. With the

termination of the Union goes national enslavement, if we will.

Freedom from any outside enemy is now ours, and nobody but ourselves

can prevent us achieving it.


We are free now to get back and to keep all that was

taken from us. We have no choice but to turn our eyes again to

Ireland. The most completely anglicised person in Ireland will look to

Britain in vain. Ireland is about to revolve once again on her own

axis.

We shall no longer have anyone but ourselves to blame if

we fail to use the freedom we have won to achieve full freedom. We are

now on the natural and inevitable road to complete the work of Davis

and Rooney, to restore our native tongue, to get back our history, to

take up again and complete the education of our countrymen in the

North-East in the national ideal, to renew our strength and refresh

ourselves in our own Irish civilization, to become again the Irish men

and Irish women of the distinctive Irish nation, to make real the

freedom which Davis sang of, which Rooney worked for, which Tom Clarke

and Seán MacDermott and their comrades fought and died for.


The British have given up their claim to dominate us.

They have no longer any power to prevent us making real our freedom.

The complete fulfilment of our full national freedom can, however,

only be won when we are fit and willing to win

it.


Can we claim that we are yet fit and willing? Is not our

country still filled with men and women who are unfit and unwilling?

Are we all yet educated to be free? Has not the greater number oF us

still the speech of the foreigner on our tongues? Are not even we, who

are proudly calling ourselves Gaels, little more than imitation

Englishmen?


But we are free to remedy these things. Complete

liberty—what it stands for in our Gaelic

imagination—cannot be got until we have impregnated the whole of

our people with the Gaelic desire. Only then shall we be worthy of the

fullest freedom.


The bold outline of freedom has been drawn by the

glorious efforts of the last five years; only the details

 remain to be filled in. Will not those who co-operated in

the conception and work of the masterpiece help with the finishing

touches? Can we not see that the little we have not yet gained is the

expression of the falling short of our fitness for freedom? When we

make ourselves fit we shall be free. If we could accept that truth we

would be inspired again with the same fervour and devotion by our own

‘grim resolve’ within the nation to complete the work which is so

nearly done.
