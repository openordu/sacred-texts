#### Notes


This poem was written for M'Glashan's Dublin University Magazine. M'Glashan, however, did not use it in that periodical, but gave it in H.R. Montgomery's Specimens of the Early Native Poetry of Ireland, 1846, where it first appeared. It, like 'Dark Rosaleen', was founded on an unrhymed version in Ferguson's articles on Hardiman's Irish Minstrelsy (Dublin University Magazine, 1834). (D.J. O'Donoghue.)

p.8


[1](javascript:footNote('E840000-003/note001.html'))[2](javascript:footNote('E840000-003/note002.html'))1. Where is my Chief, my Master, this bleak night, mavrone!
  
O, cold, cold, miserably cold is this bleak night for Hugh,
  
It's showery, arrowy, speary sleet pierceth one through and through,
  
Pierceth one to the very bone!


---

p.9

4. Rolls real thunder? Or was that red vivid light
  
Only a meteor? I scarce know; but through the midnight dim
  
The pitiless ice-wind streams. Except the hate that persecutes him
  
Nothing hath crueler venomy might.
5. An awful, a tremendous night is this, meseems!
  
The flood-gates of the rivers of heaven, I think, have been burst wide—
  
Down from the overcharged clouds, like unto headlong ocean's tide,
  
Descends grey rain in roaring streams.
6. Though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods,
  
Though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea,
  
Though he were a wild mountain eagle, he could scarce bear, he,
  
This sharp, sore sleet, these howling floods.
7. O mournful is my soul this night for Hugh Maguire!
  
Darkly as in a dream, he strays! Before him and behind
  
Triumphs the tyrannous anger of the wounding wind,
  
The wounding wind, that burns as fire!
8. It is my bitter grief—it cuts me to the heart—
  
That in the country of Clan Darry this should be his fate!
  
O woe is me, where is he? Wandering, houseless, desolate,
  
Alone, without or guide or chart!
9. Medreams I see just now his face, the strawberry-bright,
  
Uplifted to the blackened heavens, while the tempestuous winds

p.10


Blow fiercely over and round him, and the smiting sleet-shower blinds
  
The hero of Galang to-night!
10. Large,large affliction unto me and mine it is,
  
That one of his majestic bearing, his fair stately form,
  
Should thus be tortured and o'erborne—that this unsparing storm
  
Should wreak its wrath on head like his!
11. That his great hand, so oft the avenger of the oppressed,
  
Should this chill, churlish night, perchance, be paralysed by frost—
  
While through some icicle-hung thicket— as one lorn and lost—
  
He walks and wanders without rest.
12. The tempest-driven torrent deluges the mead,
  
It overflows the low banks of the rivulets and ponds—
  
The lawns and pasture-grounds lie locked in icy bonds
  
So that the cattle cannot feed.
13. The pale bright margins of the streams are seen by none.
  
Rushes and sweeps along the untamable flood on every side—
  
It penetrates and fills the cottagers' dwellings far and wide—
  
Water and land are blent in one.
14. Through some dark woods, 'mid bones of monsters, Hugh now strays,
  
As he confronts the storm with anguished heart, but manly brow—
  
Oh! what a sword-wound to that tender heart of his were now
  
A backward glance at peaceful days.
15. But other thoughts are his—thoughts that can still inspire
  
With joy and onward-bounding hope the bosom of Mac-Nee—
  
Thoughts of his warriors like bright billows of the sea,
  
Borne on the wind's wings, flashing fire!
16. And though frost glaze to-night the clear dew of his eyes,
  
And white ice-gauntlets glove his noble fine fair fingers o'er,
  
A warm dress is to him that lightning-garb he ever wore,
  
The lighting of the soul, not skies.
17. [3](javascript:footNote('E840000-003/note003.html'))
  
Hugh marched forth to fight—I grieved to see him so depart;
  
A lo! to-night he wanders frozen, rain-drenched, sad, betrayed—
  
But the memory of the lime-white mansions his right hand hath laid
  
In ashes, warms the hero's heart!
