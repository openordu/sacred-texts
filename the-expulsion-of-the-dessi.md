#### Notes

I would like to thank Donnchadh Ó Corráin for supplying the following summary from his forthcoming book, *Medieval Irish Manuscripts* (Turnhout: Brepols 2015). "The story is known under various names: 'Tucait Indarba na nDéssi'; 'Tairired na nDéisi'; 'Tochomlod na nDési ó Themraig' (recension 1, 8th century; recension 2, 11th century, c. AD 1050). The migration legend of the Déisi, from Tara to Leinster and then to East Munster where they got land for settlement through their offspring, Eithne Uathach, wife of Óengus mac Nad Fraích, king of Cashel. The tale is not historical and it links the Déisi to the legends of Uí Néill. It is, however, based in part on narratives and genealogies that go back at least to the seventh century. To this is attached an early settlement tract, Do thoirgib na nDéssi, an invaluable listing of early lineages and lordships. There is a short Latin summary in Dublin, Trinity College Library, 1298 (olim H. 2. 7), col. 78 and a longer Latin version in the *Life of St Declán* by Charles Plummer. It includes the texts 'Ceithri maic batar la hArttchorb mac Mes Chuirb .i. Brecc & Óengus & Eochuid & Forad' (recension 1); 'Cid dia tá cóechad Cormaic hi Temraig?' (recension 2)."

### The Expulsion of the Dessi: Author: Unknown




---

p.105


These are the Wanderings of the Dessi (which are put here) because of their kinship with the Fothairt; and they were thirty years in Leinster.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artchorp son of Messchorp had four sons, to wit, Brecc and Oengus and Eochuid and Forad. Forad, however, was the son of a bondmaid and did not get any land, and he was the eldest of them. Oengus had the strength of fifty men.Now the King of Tara had a wanton son, to wit, Conn mac Cormaic, who forcibly seized the daughter of Forad — Forach was her name — and ravished her. Then Oengus set out in search of the girl and went to Tara. He did not secure the chains which were on the [valve?] of the lance; for a man was needed for each of these two chains of his always. He saw his foster-child sitting at the right hand of the King's son. ‘We have not heard of this new alliance,’ said Oengus. The King's son answered: ‘Grant me the respite of a grown-up person! In any case, thou wilt have to bear it, though thou do not grant it.’ ‘To begin with, I will not bear it!’ said Oengus and ran the lance through him. Then one of the two chains struck the eye of the King, so that it broke in his head; and when he

p.107



pulled the lance back, its butt end struck the cup-bearer and passed through him so that he died the first.[1](javascript:footNote('T302005/note001.html')) It was from the chains that his name was Oengus of the Dread Lance.Hence Achaill was built by the side of Tara, that is to say, a rath was dug by Cormac in which he would always sleep; for it was not lawful for a king with a blemish to sleep in Tara. Hence is said Achaill by Tara (or near Tara), on account of the care (faichill) taken of the eye of the King.The King's son died, and Oengus took the woman away with him.Cormac sent hosts against the Dessi, who were routed in seven battles under the leadership of Oengus and his brother's sons, to wit, Russ and Eogan. To the end of forty days Oengus was king after Brecc, and then every man murmurs, for they could not endure the combined power of the prince and the champion together. It is then he said: ‘Take possession of the kingship! My own strength is best for me.’The King of Tara gathered the men of Ireland against them, and did not grant them fair fight, so that they left his land to him. Then they went into Leinster to Fiachu Bacceda, son of Cathair, who drove the Hui Bairrche for them out of their land; and there the Dessi were settled until the time of Crimthann, son of Enna

Censelach, son of Labraid, son of Bressal Belach, son of Fiachu Bacceda.There chanced to be a famous warrior with the Hui Bairrchi, to wit, Eochu Guinech, son of Oengus, and he it was who drove them out of their land. Then Crimthann, son of Enna, sent the wandering host of the Dessi to Ard Ladrann southward, whence the Land of the Wandering Host and the Folk of the Wandering Host have been so called ever since.Meld, the daughter of Ernbrand, the wife of Crimthand, bore sons to Crimthand and then died, whereupon Cumin, the daughter of Ernbrand, was married to him. Cumin bore him a daughter, even Ethne the Dread. In the night when Ethne was born Bri, the druid, son of Bairchid was in the stronghold. ‘The maiden that has been born to-night,’ said Bri, ‘all the men of Ireland shall know her, and on account of this maiden her mother's kindred will seize the land on which they shall dwell.’ When they heard the truth of that story from the druid, that it was through the power of the maiden that they would obtain inheritance, they reared her on the flesh of little boys that she might grow quickly. Hence Ethne the Dread was her name, for the little boys dreaded her.

Now, it was that druid's grandfather, who had sung their wanderings to them as they went from the north to the battle of Truistiu. 'Tis then he said: &c.

> 
> ‘Not from Tara’ ....
> 
> 
> 

Then messengers were sent from Cormac after the sons of Brecc, even Russ and Eogan, that they should come back to Cormac. When Oengus heard that, he said to them: ‘Is it true,’ said he, ‘that they have come on an errand of peace and treaty with you?’ ‘It is true,’ said they. ‘We are to be absolved of everything that we have done, and we are to have twice as much again as our own land, together with our own land and full peace till Doom.’ ‘Do not do it,’ said Oengus, ‘leave me not alone!

p.113



You shall have two thirds of the land which we shall clear, precedence to your children over my own children till Doom, and my own children to go to battle and across the border before every one, and to be the last to come out of the enemy's land. And they shall clear the land before you. Do not leave me!’ Then they did that, and truth was pledged for it, to wit, truth of breast and cheek, of heaven and earth, of sun and moon, of dew and drop, of sea and land.Eochaid, son of Artchorp, went over sea with his descendants into the territory of Demed, and it is there that his sons and grandsons died. And from them is the race of Crimthann over there, of which is Teudor son of Regin, son of Catgocaun, son of Cathen, son of Cloten, son of Nougoy, son of Arthur, son of Petr, son of Cincar, son of Guortepir, son of Aircol, son of Triphun, son of Aed Brosc, son of Corath, son of Eochaid Allmuir, son of Artchorp.Cormac, the grandson of Conn, played a trick upon two soldiers of Oengus the King, to wit, Grainne and Moinne, from whom Granraige and Moinrige are so called. He caused it to be said to either of them in the absence of the other: ‘Small is thy esteem with thy king, O Grainne. Thou art not deemed worthy to be compared to Moinne the Gall.’ The same thing was said to Moinne. Then the latter said to Oengus: ‘If I am put in comparison with Grainne, I shall put this spear through thee.’ When Cormac knew the order of the watch which would come

to them on the same night together ... Tis they who let in a host upon him in his fortress, and one of them wounded him, and his brother's son was slain together with him.Thereupon Crimthann sent them into Ard Ladrann. And after the death of Crimthann, his sons made war upon the Dessi; and one of them, Eochu, took the oak with its roots to them. And in a rout they drove them out into the land of Ossory.There in the east by the meeting of the Three Waters on a point of the land of Tigernach they dwelt. Early one morning, after they had built their dwellings, the King of Ossory saw them. ‘Yonder,’ he said, ‘are a thousand houses (mile tige) and a thousand smokes.’ Hence Miledach is so-called. He put fire to them, and all their dwellings are burnt. After that there was no place for them in the east to stay in. They fared forth and went along the sea westward until they settled in Irchuilenn in the (south-)west.At that time the wife of Oengus son of Nadfraich, King of Cashel, died, and a messenger was sent by him to the Dessi to woo the maiden Ethne, for she had been with them in the west. Oengus promised her three wishes. These were her three wishes, to wit, that the meadow land

of Cashel from Luasc to Cashel be given to her, for her mother's kindred to dwell there, that the tribe which they would choose should clear the land before them, which should then belong to them; and that they should be as free as the three Eoganacht of Munster, to wit, the Eoganacht of Raithlenn, the Eoganacht of Loch Lein and the Eoganacht of the Hui Fidgenti together with the Hui Liathain.Then the Dessi chose the people of Ossory to be cleared out before them and to fight against. There were two druids with the Dessi, to wit, Drong and Cecht; and there was also a druid with those of Ossory, Dil, the descendant of Crecca, and the druids of the Dessi had been foster-sons of his. The Dessi fought seven battles with the men of Ossory at Lethet Laidcind in Ard Catha, in all of which they were routed by the men of Ossory.Then Ethne the Dread advised her mother's kinsfolk to go to the chief counsellor of Munster, the seer-judge of Cashel, Lugaid Laigde Cosc. He by his wisdom and prudence helped them. He was judge to the Corco Laigdi. For there had been an interchange between the Corco Laigdi and the Eoganacht in Cashel (from the time of Darfine and Dercthine), to wit, whenever there was a king of the Corco Laigdi, there was a judge of the Eoganacht. Oengus, son of Nadfraich, was king at that time, and Lugaid Laigde Cosc was judge.


---

p.119


The nobles of the Dessi, and Ethne the Dread with them, went to Lugaid Cosc and said to him: ‘Help us! Thou shalt have land with us for it without rent, without seizure, without levy of host or food, nor shall we ever trespass against thy descendants.’ The truth of Oengus and of Ethne and of the princes of the Dessi is pledged for this. ‘Call your druids to me,’ said Lugaid Cosc, ‘even Droch and Cecht.’ They were called to him, and they gave them two jars full of wine, which had been brought to them from the lands of Gaul, together with food of Gaul; for he who would eat and drink it would be intoxicated and sober (at the same time). ‘Take this gift to your tutor and say to him that ye repent of fighting against him. And he will instruct his daughter after he has drunk the wine.’They did so. And Dil accepted the gift, and the girl divided it and opened (?)... before them. Dil, however, was blind. Then, when he was drunk, the maiden asked him before his two foster-sons: ‘O my venerable (father)’ said she, ‘will there be rescue for the Dessi now?’ ‘Indeed, there will be,’ said Dil, ‘if the sun rise upon them in battle-order and they slay and wound no one. For he who will first slay or wound any one of the other host to-morrow morning, shall not inhabit this land till Doom.’ ‘Perhaps there will be no

slaying then,’ said the girl, so that the young men should hear it. ‘If I were in the company of the Dessi, I should by magic shape a man into a red cow, so that the men of Ossory would kill that cow.’Forthwith the druids repair northward to Cashel to the Dessi and take them with them in battle-order early on the next morning. They light a fire of rowan there and send its smoke eastward into Ossory. Thereupon the men of Ossory come to Inneoin, and it was proclaimed by Dil that no one of the Dessi should be slain or wounded there. But the druids of the Dessi formed an old serf, Docheth by name, into the shape of a red (hornless) cow, promising freedom to his descendants for ever. Then the cow went to encounter the men of Ossory and flings herself upon them, and ... [2](javascript:footNote('T302005/note002.html')) ... and is killed at the ford westward of Inneoin whence the Ford of the Red Cow is so called. And then they saw it was the body of a man that had been slain.The men of Ossory were routed eastward as far as the Andobur, and there they turn and take their

wounded and their dead nobles into the front part of Rath Machuthnoe (on the bank of the Andobur) in the east. Again they were routed from the Andobur to the Lainnen (which is the boundary between the Dessi and the men of Ossory till Doom. They ran away like deer (ossa).) As the Dessi were returning from the east they killed the wounded men whom those of Ossory had left behind in the front part of the fortress. Hence the Road of Death along the front of the fortress is so called.Thereupon the Dessi divide those lands into four parts. Each family which came into this first division has its share in the land. There are fifty septs among the Dessi, of whom twenty-five got a share, while the other twenty-five did not; and the former are called Dessi, for it is they who are under rent and law and hut-tax to the princes, viz, to the Division of Fiachu Suidge, and the latter are not called Dessi. Every exiled band, however, of which Ethne the Dread knew in Ireland, she gathered to the Dessi, because the Division of Fiachu Suidge had been diminished in so many battles.
Of the septs of the Dessi

one-finger around the boss of the shield. In that way he was instructed to slay the peopie of Carpre on either side of the Boyne. Hence they went into exile into the territory of Leinster. After Fiachu Sraiptine and Colla Uais and Colla Menn of the Mugdoirn had slain the king of the Dessi, Brecc, son of Artchorp, the men of Leinster drove one third of the host westward to Commur. They sent to Cashel to ask help of Oengus. Tis there he killed Fedelmid Clar, the descendant of Brigit and Anlathe, son of Eogan, in Etarbaine. Hence is the Cairn of Brigit, daughter of Dubthach, son of Dub, son of Lugaid, of Ulster.Now, the third who came from the north, 'tis they that reared the maiden Ethne the Dread, the daughter of Crimthann. The men of Ossory and the Corco Laigdi went into exile together, for they ... 
  

 They took land from the Meeting of the Three Waters as far as Birr in Leinster. When they were in the land of Ossory, as far as Eochair in the east. Hence the Ford of the Fothairt and the Oakwood of Leinster in Ossory are so called. At the same time the Dessi went to Gabruan (Gabran) and the Féni to Fid Már and the Fothairt to Gabruan (Gabran), in the east.
