p.104


1. 1] Lone and weary as I wander'd
  
2] by the bleak shore of the sea,
  
3] Meditating and reflecting
  
4] on the world's hard destiny,
2. 5] Forth the moon and stars 'gan glimmer,
  
6] in the quiet tide beneath,
  
7] For on slumbering spring and blossom
  
8] breathed not out of heaven a breath.
3. 9] On I went in sad dejection,
  
10] careless where my footsteps bore,
  
11] Till a ruined church before me 
  
12] opened wide its ancient door, —
4. 13] Till I stood before the portals,
  
14] where of old were wont to be,
  
15] For the blind, the halt, and leper, 
  
16] alms and hospitality.
5. 17] Still the ancient seat was standing, 
  
18] built against the buttress grey,
  
19] Where the clergy used to welcome
  
20] weary trav'llers on their way;

p.105

8. 21] There I sat me down in sadness,
  
22] neath my cheek I placed my hand,
  
23] Till the tears fell hot and briny
  
24] down upon the grassy land.
9. 25] There, I said in woful sorrow,
  
26] weeping bitterly the while,
  
27] Was a time when joy and gladness 
  
28] reigned within this ruined pile; —
10. 29] Was a time when bells were tinkling,
  
30] clergy preaching peace abroad,
  
31] Psalms a-singing, music ringing
  
32] praises to the mighty God.
11. 33] Empty aisle, deserted chancel,
  
34] tower tottering to your fall,
  
35] Many a storm since then has beaten
  
36] on the grey head of your wall!
12. 37] Many a bitter storm and tempest
  
38] has your roof-tree turned away,
  
39] Since you first were formed a temple
  
40] to the Lord of night and day.

p.106

15. 41] Holy house of ivied gables,
  
42] that were once the country's boast,
  
43] Houseless now in weary wandering
  
44] are you scattered, saintly host;
16. 45] Lone you are to-day, and dismal,
  
46] — joyful psalms no more are heard,
  
47] Where, within your choir, her vesper
  
48] screeches the cat-headed bird.
17. 49] Ivy from your eaves is growing,
  
50] nettles round your green hearth-stone,
  
51] Foxes howl, where, in your corners,
  
52] dropping waters make their moan.
18. 53] Where the lark to early matins
  
54] used your clergy forth to call,
  
55] There, alas! no tongue is stirring,
  
56] save the daw's upon the wall.
19. 57] Refectory cold and empty,
  
58] dormitory bleak and bare,
  
59] Where are now your pious uses, 
  
60] simple bed and frugal fare?
20. 61] Gone your abbot, rule and order,
  
62] broken down your altar stones;
  
63] Nought see I beneath your shelter,
  
64] save a heap of clayey bones.

p.107

23. 65] O! the hardship, O! the hatred,
  
66] tyranny, and cruel war,
  
67] Persecution and oppression,
  
68] that have left you as you are!
24. 69] I myself once also prosper'd; —
  
70] mine is, too, an alter'd plight;
  
71] Trouble, care, and age have left me
  
72] good for nought but grief to-night.
25. 73] Gone my motion and my vigour —
  
74] gone the use of eye and ear,
  
75] At my feet lie friends and children,
  
76] powerless and corrupting here;
26. 77] Woe is written on my visage, 
  
78] in a nut my heart could lie —
  
79] Death's deliverance were welcome —
  
80] Father, let the old man die.
Sir Samuel Ferguson
