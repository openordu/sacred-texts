Grádh mo chroidhe1. Sweet thoughts, bright dreams, my comfort be,
  
All comfort else has flown;
  
For every hope was false to me,
  
And here I am, alone.
  
What thoughts were mine in early youth!
  
Like some old Irish song,
  
Brimful of love, and life, and truth,
  
My spirit gushed along.
2. I hoped to right my native isle,
  
I hoped a soldier's fame,
  
I hoped to rest in woman's smile
  
And win a minstrel's name—
  
Oh! little have I served my land,
  
No laurels press my brow,
  
I have no woman's heart or hand,
  
Nor minstrel honours now.
3. But fancy has a magic power,
  
It brings me wreath and crown,
  
And woman's love, the self-same hour
  
It smites oppression down.
  
Sweet thoughts, bright dreams, my comfort be,
  
I have no joy beside;
  
Oh! throng around, and be to me
  
Power, country, fame, and bride.
