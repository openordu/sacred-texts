S*unday*, July 20 *1650*. I left Dublin with a convoy of horse and foote and quartered neere Kill, about two miles from the Naas.


21. We came to Kilka, sidelong of Castledermott. We were waylayd by Sir Walter Dungan, Scurlock, and others, who were neere Bolton hill, drawen up in 5 divisions of horse. But it pleased God to give us the better in the engagement: we killd one Captain Shartall, and others, and tooke some prisoners, pursuing the rest some miles.


Monday, 22. We came to the army before Catherlagh *Carlow*, where Sir Hardresse Waller (Major-Generall of the foote) commaunded in absence of the Lord Deputy, who had litle before goune from the leaguer at Catherlagh towards Waterford, which had beene long kept in by garrisons and guards, so as the place thereby and by the sicknes therein raageing was greately distressed. This day began our battery at Catherlagh on the Castle on the bridge. A passage over the Barrow was by one bridge of bullrushes and another of timber.


Tu*esday*, the 23. The enemy parlied with others [*gap: illegible*]. This night was Colonel Cromwell sent to the Lord Deputy with the articles of surrender and to understand his Lordships further pleasure concerninge.

Walter Butler sent a resolute answer for [*gap: blank*] peace from Sir George Ha*milton* [*gap: illegible*] to the contrary. Thus about halfe an houre before Colonel Cooke, Colonel Sanchey, Colonel Axtel, Colonel Abbot, and Colonel Shelborne with about 2600 horse and foote forced into the Island of Melick upon the Shannone neere Birh: where were encamped and fortified about 4000 Irish foote and 400 horse of Clanricard's army.

About 500 of them were slaine, more then that number drowned in the Shanon there and at Banaghar (alias Fort Falkland), whither they were pursued and overtaken.

> 
> 
> First, I judge it to be displeasing to God to joyne in such neere relations with the people of such abominations, persons whose principles have led them to the shedding of so much innocent bloud as they have done, which God in his righteous judgment is making a severe inquiry after, and hath called over this army principally to serve his Providence in that worke hitherto and blest them in it; and that any such should upon slight pretences of conviction or conversion in them goe to take such persons into the neerest bonds of relation so as to make them the objects of their love, who (while remaining in (or not being really brought off from) those false waies in which they have or do walke) are declared by the Lord to be a people of his wrath, I thinke it very unlawfull and sinfull.
>

> Secondly, besides this, though ordinarily as a judgement upon such foule miscarriages this follows, that when persons will goe inconsiderately upon the forementioned slight pretences or any other of like nature to match with such, God many times suffers men who all the time before have beene faithfull to the worke in hand to be led aside by such temptations as they have thereby run themselves

I therefore thinke fit to let all know that if any officer or souldier of this army shall marry with any of the women of this nation that are Papists or have lately been such, and whose change of religion is not or cannot be judged by fit persons, such as shall be appointed for that end, to flow from a reall worke of God upon their hearts convincing them of the falshood and evill of their owne waies and goodnesse and truth of that way they turne unto; or that (from any circumstances accompanying their action) it shall be judged to be but from corrupt and carnall ends that they have made this change, I say that any officer who marries any such shall thereby be judged and held uncapable of command or trust in this army; and for any souldier that marries any such, if he be a horseman he shall be dismounted and cashiered from horse service to serve only in foote service (if at all), and a footeman so married shall be cashiered from his foote service and to serve onely as a pionier and neither of them be held capable of preferment for the future unlesse God doe by a change wrought upon them (with those whom they have married) take off this reproach and so give us ground to restore them. And I desire all officers of this army and others under my command that they doe their utmost endeavour (in the use of all lawfull meanes) to prevent any such sinfull contract the issue of which can be no other then to provoke God to depart from us or testifie his displeasure against us some way or other, especially when such things come to passe from our neglecte or our not doing what comes us to do to hinder anything of this nature as much as in us lyes.

These and other things necessary for the service thus and answerable ordered. His Ex: came to Clonmell from Waterford the 5 of May. Thither came also from Waterford the day following the Honourable the Commissioners for the Parliament, and the 10th at a Counsell of War was taken into consideration the way and entrance into our worke, wherein was debated: as whether his Ex: with this part of the army should make his passage over the Shannon about Limerick, considering the many difficulties appeareing in it. 2. Or whether his Lordship with the army should not rather march by the way of Vlster into Conaught, wherein were a waving of all the former difficulties. This was laid aside considering the length of the way and want of provisions, which in 



---

p.227




an inland march of that length and compass could neither be carried along nor supplied. 3. Considering the power of the enemie in Conaught ready to oppose the Lord President, and probably resolved so to do, haveing therein the advantage of engageing with one party rather than with both conjoyned: therefore if his Ex: whole army marched not that way, whether it were not adviseable that some part of it should be sent for *reenforcement* of the Lord Presidents; that opposing this was the Lord Presidents letter to his Ex: expressing his want of provision for so great worke, haveing onely provisions for 6 weekes for his owne party, not knowing how to provide for those with the Commissary Generall. The two later were thus concluded in the negative, but nothing was found in that although long debate for the affirmative how his Ex: should proceede or begin in the worke. But what was not then found in the wisdom and counsels of men appeared after in that direction which wee ought and on which we depended from the Lord. This night was there expectation of a designe on Limerick by correspondency with some within. Coll. Ingoldesby (an active and vigilant officer and well meriting of the service) appeareing in the worke had placed himselfe conveniently with 1000 horse, foote aud Dragoones, neere the city for taking hold of the oportunity to be offered, but (I know not how) the plot failing, as few in that kinde were found to take, ours retired without losse although under shot of the walls.


Wednesday, *May* 21. Wee quartered about one mile from Kilaloe, that being on the other side of the Shanon, we on this.


Friday, 23. We removed yet neerer the Shanon. Castlehaven then at Kilaloe with horse and foote had [*gap: illegible*] and continued fortifying the bankes on the other side and in writings and high discourses expressed much confidence and resolution. Yet had he demolished the house at Kilaloe called the Bishops house lying on the county of Clare side of the Shanon, and part of it in the water and serving for a strong defence against any attempt by the foord there over the Shanon which is by it. The enemy had also burnt and destroyed many castles and places of strength in Thomond on that side of the Shanon and remote from us, and that when we but appeared on the other side of the Shanon wherein we found some footsteps of the Lords goeing before us in his terror.


Saturday, 24. We possessed a small island within the Shanon betweene our campe and Kilaloe; in it were some ruines of a stone building; here was placed a guard opposite to the enemies workes on the other side.




---

p.228


Monday, *May* 26. We planted some guns *neere* that island for *cleereing* the banckes and workes on the other side whence they plyed us with their small shot. There were also brought from Dromaneere some boats and cotts which with a guard we secured above Kilaloe; of them 2 cotts were drawne over land and putt into the water at the island mentioned. A cott is a kinde of vessell of one peece hollowed and some of them capable of thirty men. In all this, and by our worke there *neere* the water and by abundance of fagots daily brought thither and otherwaies, the enemy (and most of ours also) conceived his Ex: designed to have beene for getting over thereabout onely or principally. But his Lordship (therein gaining what he intended their apprehending it so) had his thoughts elsewhere workeing, haveing observed a place about 2 miles thence below the island much more commodious for that he purposed, and toward his worke there had his preparations in the adjoyning woods, by which and with what materialls were expected to be brought to us by Coll. Sankey from Clonmel there was hope of makeing our passage (in time) by a bridge over the Shanon. Yet in our whole worke and proceedings in it were found daily difficulties more then we could by our counsels or endeavors overcome, all things to our apprehensions moveing slowly and heavily to our no small discouragements. We were also much perplexed by our doubts and care of our freind whom before then was expected in Connaught of whom we had yet heard nothing, whereunto was added that this now related of Coll. Fitz Patricks besieging our garrison of Birh about 20 miles from us with a numerous party.


Wednesday, 28. This day therefore was by his Ex: appointed and set apart for seeking God that he would be pleased gratiously to afford us his presence and direct us in our way, walking hitherto in darknesse and professing to each other that we know not what to do: and that the Lord would make a way for those our freinds then (we hoped) marching but through an *enemies* country, whose suffrings had beene (probably) a check to our whole designe. This day was Major Morgan sent with a party of horse and dragoones for reenforcing those few the day before with Major Boughton for releiveing of Birh.


Thursday, 29. His Ex: by letters from Capt. Branly from aboard his ship in the Shanon was certified of his being possessed of Sir Tege Mac Mahons castle in Thomond on the other side of the Shanon and neere it; that he had fortified it and repulsed the enemy attempting the recovering it. This was our first footing on the other side of the Shanon and was joyfully received of us as an earnest of what the Lord would doe in his due time for perfecting his worke by us. Herein was an occasion given for some debate whether it were not adviseable to send part of the army about to be that way ferried over into

p.229




Thomond, which being in the backe of the enemy might distract them and contribute to the openinge our way over the Shanon where they attempted it. But considering the length of the way and not knowing what occasion we might have of our forces intire, and that being so divided either party would be lesse considerable; therefore was that designe laid by. This day also by letters from the Lord of Broghill was signified his engageing Force with the enemy of whom many were slaine and taken.[7](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note007.html')) And this day we understood of the defeat of the enemy at and about the Birh, some particulars whereof are as followeth: That Fitz Patrick with 300 horse and about 1300 foot had the 28th instant about 7 in the morning appeared before the castle of Birh: that they had laid to the walls 11 ladders bearing 2 on brest: that others wrought on the wall with pickaxes in 4 places; that being beaten backe they renewed the assault bringing with them a certaine engine called a sow (in the hollownes whereof many might worke shot free) for breaking through the wall: that some of those carrying the sow to the wall being shot the rest fled; that the enemy being then also beaten of, they made a third attempt but with no better successe; that of them 70 were slaine on the place and many wounded; that the enemy drawing away into a wood about 3 miles thence that party sent by Major Boughton from the head quarters being come to Birh and following them overtooke them in the wood, and falling on unexpectedly routed them, killed some of their foote, the rest fleeing into the adjoyning bogge: and of the horse were killed 2 cornets and 60 others. There were taken a lewetenant, a corporall, and about 100 horse with armes and furniture, their riders escaping. In all which and in what followes is appeareing that it is not in vain to seek the Lord.


June, Lord's day, 1. Our spies this day returning brought us the first certaine intelligence of the Lord June. President of Conaught and the Commissarys Generall being in Conaught, that they were therein well advanced, haveing slipt by Clanricards army laid to stop their passage, of whom by a neerer and unexpected way they gained ground and were there come betweene Clanricards army and us, to the generall amazement of all Conaught all fleeing before them, and that Clanricard was following and ours hastening to Portumny, the place by his Ex: appointed them. As in this we had the comfort of freinds well-being (whereof we had been till then very solicitous) so had we heerein as it were a call from God to be up and doing.

Heereunto had the Lord raised the spirits of our men unanimously even before we heard any thing of that now reported out of Conaught, this serving onely as an encouragement to our proceedings in what was before concluded the now endeavouring our passage over the Shanon. Our preparations at present to this our passage were cotts and boates in severall places: At the end of the wood above Kilaloe we had one cott and one boate both capable of about 40 men. And neere our worke at the island below Kilaloe were laid 2 cotts, but being in a rough water they were not of any use to us nor were they intended there for more then for allarming the enemy, there being ordered after to slip down the river towards Brian's bridge. Also at Brian's bridge wee had one boate and 2 cotts where might be 40 wafted at once. Brian's bridge was looked on as the principall and most hopefull place for our worke. It hath the name of a bridge if any had beene there aunciently which might occasion the name, yet were there not now so much as the ruins of any such thing. Toward the other shore and in the water standeth the stump of an old castle. This we hoped to possesse by ladders to that end prepared, and having gained it to cleere at least in part the contrary shore for a landing place for more men to be sent after. On the land and neere the water were the ruines of an old house wherein was a guard of the enemies for opposeing our landing. This also being gained might be (as we conceived) some defence for the present, joyned with that of the castle answering it. We had also prepared pallisadoes, and turne-pikes for a suddaine entrenchment untill we could worke ourselves into more security and thereby secure a place for our landing at leasure when thereunto fitted, which was not at present hoped for. There was an island in the river capeable of about 2000 men. This lay about halfe way to which and from which was designed the reachings of our bridge, whereof some materialls were already fitted, and more were expected by Coll. Sankey. As for the other places about Kilaloe or attempts there were intended rather for amuseing the enemy while we hoped (by Gods assistance) to gaine our ends heere. Hither his Ex: had this day drawne a party of horse and foote and some gunnes, his Lordship with the Lieutenant Generall being with them, and Sir Hardresse Waller being left with the rest of the army to order the worke about Kilaloe,


Monday, *June* 2. About breake of day Capt. Draper (of Coll. Sadlers regiment) ordered by his Ex: to fall downe the river with 3 files of firelockes, and to passe to the opposite shore at Brians bridge, resolutely performed his worke and notwithstanding the opposition made he gained the house on the other side. The castle also in the water was possessed by others appointed to that worke. Those first landing were ordered to fasten long ropes or cables to the shoare whereby boats might be towed over, which was done and was of great use for our speedy passing over, so as within an houre we had landed 500 men on Thomond side of the water. The enemy at first with some horse and foote gave opposition but by the loud shoutings of our men from the other side and sounding of trumpets and dischargeing our great shot, and by shot made from the castle and house last taken, it pleased God to strike such terror into their

hearts that they quitted their worke and fled. Coll: Ingoldesby was by his Ex. ordered with 300 horse and dragoones to attempt his passing the Shanon about the same time elsewhere, which he did about Castle Connell belowe Brians bridge witheout opposition: he fell upon some of the fleeing enemy makeing towards Limerick from whom he gained a small gunne before drawen from Limerick to be used against us. Castlehaven (whose quarters were at Kilaloe) had the night before heard that the Lord President (Sir Charles Coote) and the Comissary Generall were advanced as farre as Gortinsegory in the county of Galway, about [*gap: blank*] miles from Kilaloe, which was but a false alarum; yet did that also contribute much to our worke: the Lord in that (as in that apprehended noise of chariots and horsemen, *where* none were, he made the Syrians flee besieging Samaria 2. Kings. 7: 6:)[8](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note008.html')) causing our enemies a generall feare that by the coming on of that our party they might be by them and us enclosed and destroyed. Therefore conceived they it high time to provide for theire security; yet for colouring theire so goeing away Castlehaven gave out that he would hasten to joyne with Clanricard for opposeing Sir Charles Coote, and that lesse numbers then those with him would suffice to oppose those attempting over the river. But that his marching away was soone turned to plain fleeing, newes being brought him of our so landing at Brian's bridge, whereupon they all fled and quitted their defences about Kilaloe and gave ours there also a quiet landing. For about breake of day at the wood above Kilaloe our men drawne thither were some of them landed on the other side without opposition notwithstanding great number of the enemy there standing and looking on awhile, as amazed not finding theire hands but after fleeing every where. Castlehaven himselfe fled leaveing his tent, plate, and other conveniences for a prey. We found there 50 bundles of good pikes and 5 barrells of powder with bullets and match and pistols and carabine bullets in good proportions, also many pioneers tooles, and in the trenches and workes on the river we found many armes and tooles, those who should have used them being fled with their generall. Castlehaven's forces were (by the country) numbred to us for 5 regiments of horse and as many of foote but nothing answerable in numbers: yet more than enough (looking to man) for opposeing anything we could doe considering the difficulty of passing the river, which we found dangerous enough without any opposition otherwaies. This day was spent for the most part in ferrying and foording our horse and foote about Kilaloe. A garrison being left at Kilaloe, the Major-Generall with that part of the army marched to Brians bridge to his Ex: whereon both sides of the river the whole army quartered. A guarison was laid at Kilaloe which hath bene since then by us fortefied as in the annexd mappe of it is appeareing.


Tuesday, *June* 3. Wee marched toward Limerick. In our way thither and neere it we heard much

shooteing, which we found to be by Collonel Ingoldesbie's party then skirmishing with the enemy. The enemy had drawen out of Limerick about 300 horse with some foote for defending against us the passe of Forboe (about a mile from Limerick). It had a narrow way with bogges on both sides and the ruines of a stone building in forme of a gate at the end of it which was next Limerick. Within that stood the enemy drawen up ready to receive Collonel Ingoldesby who was ready to force them, and force them he did with his horse and dragoones breakeing through the passe. The enemy fled toward Limerick, ours pursuing and killing many even at Thomond Bridge not farre from the very walls, and forced many into the water where they perished. There were slaine and lost of them about 150 and some prisoners taken, of whom were some officers and men of note. Ours got 100 serviceable horse and armes and much cattell which were a very great reliefe to our army. This was a seasonable mercy, God therein opening for us our way toward Limerick. His Excellency with the army came soone after to that passe and quarterd within it before Limerick.


Wednesday, June 4. His Lordship had orderd a party of horse and foote to ly at distance on the other side of Limerick. These were *reenforced* by Collonel Sankey's party this day come to us from Clonmell. By him we heard of supplies of men then landed at Waterford.


Thursday, *June* 5. His Excellency received letters (his first) from the Lord President of Conaught, certifying his then being at Portumny, the place appointed him, that Clanricards forces were drawing towards him, and desireing farther orders from his Excellency. I shall heerein give a breife of the proceedings of that army, hitherto that the way of Gods providence ordering them to our time and worke may be observed to his glory. The Commissary-Generall takeing the charge of the 400 Leinster horse ordered by his Excellency, (as before page—) to joyne with the Lord President of Conaught, the 1 of May he marched from Dundalke in the county of Louth (the way into Ulster), the 3d they quarterd at Newton in the Co: of Tirone. There they met the Colrane regiment of foote, and thither came the Lord President to meet the Commissary-Generall, both thence going to Londonderry. The 5th they marched neere Strabane. The 9th to Barnesmoore (a mountaine, for the most part either bogge or rock, and in either respect of difficult passage). Heere met them more horse and foote. The 10th marching over Barnesmoore they quartered short of Dungall; the 11th short of Balishanon. The 12th they marched over the river of Balishanon where they continued 4 daies. Thither came the Lord President with a party of horse and foote. Thence the 17th they marched within 6 miles of Sligoe, where they continued 2 daies. The 20th they passed the river of Sligoe, where they rested 5 daies expecting the comming upp of

Collonel Russel's regiment and some horse from Collonell Venables, and 5 companies from Derry, who by hand drew 2 feild peices over Barnes moore till then thought impassable for the lightest carriages. The 26 they marched from within 2 miles of Sligoe on Conaught side 2 miles farther to the bridge of Killone. Hither came more of the Lord President's forces. Thence were some sent to discover the enemy and to gett (if it might be) some provisions for the army whereof there was great want. By discovery they found that Clanricarde with a considerable part of his army had possessed the passages of the **Carlewes**, a place of exceeding great advantage to them, and disadvantage to ours if that way forceing their passage. This being an apparent hazarding the army, and that any disaster to them, or but delaying them in their march must be a prejudice to the whole service; therefore was it concluded most adviseable to finde their passage some other way. And accordingly leaveing the Carlewes on the left hand they turned toward the sea, and by strange and unexpected waies by Ballaghy passe got undiscovered into the county of Mayo. Heerein they gained the advantage of open ground for their horse and gained in ground of the enemie neere 2 daies march who were now in the reare of them. Clanricard one whole day expected the marching on of our army, and not heareing of them found by discovery the reason, whereupon he hastened after them and with all sent into all places to send away their cattell and goods out of our way: the 31st of May the Lord President by easy marches came to Athenrie, and hearing that a party of the enemy was at Loughroagh the army marched thither the 2d of June. All meanes were used for draweing out the enemy to an engagement, but they keeping within the towne, spent much of that day in skirmishing. Thence the same day the army marched 2 miles in the way to Portumny. The next morning the Lord President heard that Castlehaven had come the night before to Loughroagh, intending to joyne with Clanricard for engageing him there; also he heard that his Excellency had passed the Shanon; wherefore, hastening to Portumny he thence by letters certified his Excellency (as is said) of his being there and of the reports of the enemies intentions concerning him, which his letters coming to his Ex: the 5th instant the Lewetenant Generall was imediately dispatched with 10 troupes of horse and 6 of dragoones for joyning with that army in any such engagements. The same day our vessels with provisions attending us in the Shanon came neerer to us. His Ex: haveing viewed all places of advantage for blocking up the towne on Thomond side, there was this day begun a worke neere Thomond Bridge capable of 1000 foote and of one troupe of horse. Limerick is devided into 2 parts one called the city [*gap: blank*][9](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note009.html'))


June: Monday, 9. This day we landed some gunns and morter peeces out of the shipping.

Tuesday, *June* 10. Wee heard of a defeate given Muskrey by our forces commanded by the Lord of Broghill. We heard alsoe that Carigouholt in Thomond, belonging to Sir Daniell O Bryen, was possessed by ours. This day was Sir Hardress Waller sent from the leagure for ordering the recruits lately landed at Waterford. Captain Vernon went also, intending for England, the fruites of whose negotiations with the Parliament after found to a generall advantage.


Wednesday, 11. There was a conuoy sent with provisions for the armie in Conaught, whereof they had bin in great want, their provisions being to be boated at Killaloe were thence carried to Portumny.


Fryday, 13. This day was set apa*rt* for prayseing the Lord for his mercyes to us in bringing us over the Shanon, and for his goodnes to vs and to our freinds in Conaught, which, wheresoever remembered, even in a very dyary, it deserveth more then the bare mentioneing of it, all the parts of that worke being full of God, and his ffotesteps fownd in every motion of it, and all of it soe his that nothing of it could be ascribed to our councell or power for ordering or carrying on all thinges as wee had [*gap: blank*] his providence ordeined and done for vs. I cannot therefore (at leaste for my selfe), but lay by mee some particulars herein observable to the glory of his name, and the stirring vp our hearts in praiseing him, and for trusting in him in all things concerning vs for the future. When wee consider 1. The obstructions wee fownd in our councels before our setting fourth, and since, and that notwithstanding many meetings for seeking the Lord, wherein hee seemed not to answere vs, in all which wee parted noe way satisfyed, but that wee fownd nothing to trust vnto or what to resolue vpon but in all things to trust ourselves and our worke to God's disposeing, for I observed theis our councells to end all in the negatiue what wee should not doe, nothing materially concluded in the affirmative what to doe, and sometymes wishing we had resolved and ordered some things otherwaies then they were, particularly wishing we had sent more force for reinforceing our party marching through Conaught to [*gap: illegible*] in it resolved [*gap: illegible*] but God disposed all for the better, and in all our councells and wayes wee weere as Abraham following the Lord ourselves not well knowing whither to goe or whither to fix, goeing or rather being carried on in the right way sucesfully. 2. Considering the obstructions fownd in our worke and in our preparations to it: 1. Altogeather fayling of that on which wee depended, *the* tymely comeing vnto vs of those materialls expected for our flote bridge, on which our passage seemed then to vs depending, but God ordered our worke for vs without that whereby the praies was more to his name the lesse was seene in the worke of man or of meanes. 2. As for those materialls for our worke which were at hand, they notwithstanding

p.235




all the paines and care taken for preparations, and the fitting them (which was very greate) yet did the worke stick on one hand or other which (to our noe small trouble) was by vs judged losse of tyme, but this was also from the Lord bringing all to the due tyme, and not till then, not till 1st of June; then, indeed, wee resolved on our attempting our passage, had wee bin sooner ready wee had probably attempted our worke sooner, and certaynly to a greater preiudice, but then was the due tyme; then had wee the first certainty of our freinds being in Conaught, wherein much of our care and ffeare either of their not coming att all (which considering their wants and weaknes was to be feared) or of their comeing on, with that security, considering the preparations of the enemy against them and there difficultyes, this was to our exceeding greate encouragment. There also was (in this) a discouragment to the enemie, with feare and distraction, whereby the way for our passage over the Shannon was almost miracullously opened. 3. The passage of our horse depending on their foording the river; this at our first comeing to the Shannon was impossible, but as the tyme for our passage drew neare soe did the weather serve and the river ffall, whereby wee had that day a passage at the ffoord ouer against Killaloe; nor was it then more then passable, it being then dangerous and was doubtles much more before then. 4. Considering the meanes for our then passage, but 2 boates and 3 cotts, that were vsed in all parts togeather where wee passed, not capable of numbers competent for defending themselues much less for forceing a passage for others by driveing the enemy from their strengths. 5. Considering the power of the enemie, many in number, headed with the cheife comaunders in the Irish armie, and fortifyed in their severall stations. And had they bin fewer and not soe fitted for oposeing vs yet was any thing almost sufficient for beateing vs back, where wee fownd our very passing the water only soe difficult and tedious and dangerous. 6. Notwithstanding all theire advantages their confidence and boasteing in them the day before, yet then fleeing when none persueing, whence was theis distractions? Surely not from vs, not being neere them, but from God gieving them (as the Syrians, 2 Kings, 7: 6) to flee vpon rumours of what was not soe really, as if our Connaught party were at hand ready to fall on who were farr from them calling on vs for helpeing them against a party of the same enemie. 7. Considering the seasonablenes of this greate mercy, as in other respects soe in bringing vs to our provisions in the Shannon, without which being in distress wee could not haue subsisted. 8. I cannot omitt the action of that very when wee came before Limbrick (the 3rd of June): God's goeing before to the passe of Forboe, cleareing it for vs, it being defended by the enemie, and opening that way by a partie of ours, drawen thither by providence, not otherwise designeing it and strikeing further terror of vs into the hearts of those in Lymbrick, before whos eyes their men lay slaine. 9. The Lord in all this farr exceeding our weake faith. For whereas in the attempt of then passing the Shannon wee expected noe more then a landing place for a fewe only, and by them there fortifyed in tyme to worke out our passage, for the passage God did at once finish the whole worke for vs, in bringing vs over in all

p.236




places and altogeather, and not soe only but settling vs even before Limbrick also.


Nor let the coming on of our freinds seeme little in our eyes considering bow farre tbey came, and in how great wants and notwithstanding the preparations of the enemie after them, yet God bringing them through all difficulties to the place and worke desired and carrying them on in it successfully. And that which puts the value of a choice mercy on all this is that it was given in return of prayers, God in this manifesting evidently his acceptance, and owning the desiers (such as they were) of his poore servants, for on our seekeing him the 28th May followed that heape of mercies one on the necke of another before observed and theise particularly now mentioned; not for any thing or work in our persons or workes, but of his free grace and mercy to us his unworthy servants. To him, therefore, we desire to give the glorie alone of all things done for us. In that by his Excellency published for prayseing God in theise particulars we finde much more to this purpose to which I resserve myselfe giving it at large being full of piety and not to be forgotten while these things are remembered.[10](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note010.html'))

> Forasmuch as it hath pleased the Lord, notwithstanding our utter unworthinesse and manifold great provocations, for his owne name's sake and for the glory of his mercy and grace to his people concerned in this cause, still to carry on the worke entrusted in the hands of his poore servants and to give many speciall testimonies of his presence still continuing with us, and of his mercy and favour still extended and enlarged towards us in giving such safe free and ready passage with the army over the Shannon, and that so early in the yeare as that the summer season for the remaining part of our worke is not lost or spent (as probably it might have beene) in striving for our passage, so seasonably when our being longer withheld at that distance from our shipping would suddainly have spent the small stores of bread, corne, and salt, etc., which wee had or could get above Limerick, and have brought us either into extremity and difficulty of subsistance, or into necessity (for want of a subsistence there) to have desisted from the attempting of our passage in those most hopefull places, and for supply of necessaries to have come downe to our shipping on the other side the river without a passage over it; and considering that it hath pleased God to do this in answer to the weake, worthlesse, and (almost) faithlesse prayers of his poore servants in doing it so as it might appeare to be the worke of his hands, and that his wisedome and power might be manifest in it and nothing of man or the creature in doeing it by poore, inconsiderate meanes (by the attempt first of a very few men in 2 or 3 boats or cotts) and making it (even with such meanes) so easy and safe to us though at a place as the first and principle attempt was where we had no foord neere, and the materialls for the floate bridge intended not yet come and therein exceeding our weake faith or expectations, who in the attempt did not hope or aime at more then to gaine and secure (if God pleased) a small footing on this side the river, under shelter of which we might make

> and put over a bridge in time against great opposition expected; but God was pleased above and beyond our faith by such small meanes and weake force used, (namely the sounding of trumpets and shouts) to strike by a strange working of his spirit such terror into the heartes of the enemy as that they who a little before had vainely and proudly boasted their coming with confident resolution to receave us, and had used soe much industry in their workes against us, and for a time shewed so much confidence to oppose us yet suddenly and causelesseley quitted their workes and guardes, by which they might probably and hopefully have withstood us against the best preparation we could make and all the means we could use, and run away in distraction and confusion, dissipateing and scattering themselves severall waies and leaving us many armes with ammunition and some of their best accomodation behinde them, and all passages open and free to come over at such leasure as we did where we found it difficult enough to get over when no opposition was left against us; and considering that we know not nor could heare any thing certaine concerning the condition or posture of our freinds under the Lord President of Conaught, nor they of us, yet it pleased God (who is every where present and seeth and overuleth all things) so to dispose of our counsells and intentions as that wee (ignorantly or unwittingly) pitcht upon that time for our attempt when those our freinds (though wee know it not) were come on through Conaght, so farre this way as gave the enemie here before us some feare and apprehension of their coming downe hither upon their backs (though no such thing was intended) so as the season we were guided to attempt in was just when that apprehension contributed to their terror and fright before us. Considering also how strongly and with an high hand it hath pleased God to bring forth and carry on those our freinds from such a distance quite through a countrey so entirely possest by the enemy, and notwithstanding the numerous army that was drawne together from many parts to oppose or attend their motion (whereof we know the enemy over against us at Kilaloe so vaunted and boasted) and to bring them through all difficulties (without any losse or prejudice) to the places and businesses intended and desired hath given sudainely into their hands Loghreagh, Portumny, and diverse other places of consequence and further advantage, and that (as it were) in the face of the enemies grand army. In which proceedings, though we understand not particularly the severall passages and circumstances wherein the Lords hand appeared, yet we finde the effects full of mercy to them and us and advantage to our common worke; and looking at the length and difficulties of their way and march and at the advantages the enemy had against them (and might have had more both in numbers and posture for opposition and otherwise), we have abundant cause to acknowledge that the Lord hath gratiously led, guided, encouraged and blest them; and that the men of might (on the other part) have not found their hands, but he hath taken away from them the hearts of men, stupified or terrified their spirits, distracted, infatuated, and confounded their councells and daily breaking and dividing them amongst themselves and doth all the workes of them and us his poore servants for (when we doe litle and deserve lesse) leading us in waies we know not, still neerer to the end of our worke: and soe giving us comfortable and hopefull encouragements to the strengthening of our hearts and hands in what remaines, and sweet testimonies that

I earnestly desire that the consideration of them may be set home upon all hearts amongst us that are capable thereof, and that all such officers and others who have any hearts to God wards in this worke may be stirred up, and would stir up and invoke one another to a due sense of these things, and take all opportunities and use with freedome and leisure God gives us, to meete, conferre, pray, and sing praises together in relation thereunto; particularly I doe for that purpose appoint to morrow (being Friday the 13th inst., to be set apart and kept throughout this camp and the adjacent quarters and garrisons that can have notice of it) as a day for publique thankesgiving and acknowledgment to the Lord of his faithfulnesse of all his people concerned with or in this cause, his mercy and favour to us his unworthy servants, and his glorious power, wisedome, and justice to the enemies appeareing in these his dealings and outgoings before mentioned, and in the many successes hee hath further given to severall parties of ours as at Burr and neere it to the partie that came immediately before the army hither to our small party sent over before us into the west partes of this county of Thomond and to our forces in the co: of Corke, Tiperary and elsewhere whereof we have heard and do heare daily comfortable tideings. And to stir up one another and humbly seeke to God that with theise experiences and considerations of his wisedome and power before us, and of his goodnesse towards us, we may (through his grace) have a right sense and impression of them upon our hearts (so as to owne and acknowledge him alone therein and not to be lifted up in any conceit of our selves above our enemies and from the sense of his power and presence so neere at hand may be kept humble under the consideration of our unworthiness and great provocations and in trembling and feare before him to declare, abominate, and oppose these evill practices amongst us that are so unworthy of him and unsuitable to his presence or dishonorable to his name, and may be provoked to answer his mercies with suiteable fruits and improvements of them and not to be left to the deadness and corruption of our hearts, which would pervert and deprave them all to his dishonour and our owne hurt. And that we may still goe on in his name and strength alone and in faith answerable to such experiences and so may find his continued presence and blessings with us in what remaines to be done to the greater glory of his name, and rejoyceing of his people.

Saturday, *June* 14. His Ex: this day sumoned Limerick. A battery of 28 guns being prepared against the castle on Thomond bridge they began to play; 2 morter peices placed neere that battery began now also to play. A slate of an house in the towne cast of of by a morter shott killed a child in a woman's armes, that child being coffind and buried

was after by another shott cast out of its grave. There were men drawne downe toward the castell below the island. And this day we heard that Clanricard and Castlehaven, seing Gods hand against them, had left the army and gone by sea from Gallway.


Lord's day, *June* 15. Our battery of guns and morter peeces continued to play, those at the castle on the bridge, theise into the towne. There was another batterie for guns made neerer the castle, and guns drawne to the castle below the island, and more foote sent thither comanded by Coll. Totthill.


Monday, 16. By a great shott made at the castle below the island 3 of the enemy being slaine and others wounded the rest betooke themselves to their cotts, but being shot at by our musqueteers they came to the shoare, who were after put to the sword: of these there were 14. This being done by command from Coll. Totthill, they having quarter given by the souldiers, he was at a Martiall Court put therefore from his commaund.[11](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note011.html')). We possessed the castle, which was a place of good consequence. Two other mortar peeces (4 in all) played into the towne together; of these the greatest carrieing a shell weighing 200 weight was split in dischargeing but without hurt to any about it. This day was a returne made out of the towne by a drum to that summons sent the 14th, they desireing to treat and that Commissioners might be to that end appointed, and hostages given for securing the Commissioners and a cessation during the treaty.


Tuesday, 17. This day the Leivetenant Generall returned to the head quarters with his party, which had beene sent to joine with the Lord President, he hearing that the enemie had gone toward Ballinesloe bridge, he with 700 of his horse and the Comissary Generall with the like number of his and the Lord President, and with some foote followed them; but the enemy fleeing before them past hope of being by ours overtaken, ours returned having first taken the castles of Malogh and Mote in the county of Galway. The Leivetenant Generall taking leave of the Lord President he was in his returne affronted by those in the castle of Gortinse belonging to Sir Roger Shaghnus, trusting to the strength of the place; our horse and dragoones notwithstanding their not haveing any thing but their armes convenient for a storme yet forced the place after

long and great dispute. About 40 of the rebels were slaine in the storme and after, 14 shot, the castle was burnt, but the house preserved. We heard that the Lord President was marched towards Athlone, and that the castle of [*gap: blank*] on the Shannon was taken by ours; that Gallway had taken in a garrison of Irish, and that Generall Preston, (now wryteing himselfe Viscount Tarah) was their Governor. Our party on the other side of Lymerick was this day strengthened with more forces, and Coll. Ingoldesby order*ed* to command there.


Wednesday, *June* 18. A returne was given to that desired by the towne concerning the treaty that it was accepted of, but without a cessation or giveing of hostages, the word of the State being in this case alwaies held sufficient. And the towne haveing given the names of 6 Comrs (of which were 2 for the souldiers, 2 for the citty, and 2 for theire cleargy), his Ex: assented to the sending the like number, and the treaty to begin the next day at a tent provided for the Commissioners. Our bridge at Castle Connell being of wood and fixed, was finished over the Shanon, but it being of too great a distance for a lyne of communication with our party on the other side of Limerick, therefore was it ordered that a floate bridge should be made neere the castle, below the island lately taken. Some of the people of the city haveing beene by the Governor put out of the towne his Ex: ordered that they should be sent back, and declaring in wryteing to the Governor that any thenceforth so falling into our hands should be otherwise dealt withall. But he refuseing to accept of those sent back and continuing to send out more his Ex: commanded 4 of them to be knockt in the head as exemplary to others, but through mistake of orders all the others (about 40), were put to the sword, an act much disgusted by his Ex: and others of the army, yet nothing moveing with the Governour who ceased notwithstanding after so to disburden the place of such.


Thursday, 19. This day the Comissioners for the treaty met. Haveing battered and attempted the possessing ourselves of the castle on the bridge, and our ladders proveing short we drewe downe gunns for a further battry there and this night layed many fagots under the wall of it in order there unto allarumd the towne in severall places.


Saturday, 21. Wee stormed and forced and possessed the castle on the bridge, where we found 3 barrels of powder there layed for blowing up the place; and strange it was that it tooke not effect, considering that the same had beene layed and that ours entred with the casting in hand granadoes before them. The guns from that called the Kings Castle playing on the bridge tower, our guns played on them and dismounted one of them. Major Talbott, Governor of Clare Castle, haueing treated with his Ex: by one

sent to that purpose concerning the place Collonell Cromwell was sent for receiveing it; but the designe being discovered it tooke not and the Governor was seized as a prisoner. Coll. Sankey returned to the campe with his party out of Kerry. They encamped with those on the other side of Limerick.


Monday, *June* 23. It was thought adviseable to attempt the takeing of the island called the King's Island on which the city of Limerick stood which the enemy had in a good parte fortified. The attempt was to be made by boates and part of the float bridge for carrying over horse and men; 2 of the boates passeing over hastily before they could be seconded and landing about 80 men the enemie fell on them in multitudes putting all to the sword but one, which so discouraged those who were to follow that the designe was wholy laid by.


Tuesday 24. This was a day for humiliation, bewayeling the sins of the army which might occasion that the Lord's displeasure against us.


Wednesday, 25. This day we heard of the Lord President's being possessed of the Castle of Athlone, this being the most considerable passe with a bridge over the Shannon betweene Leinster and Conaught, whereby our forces in both provinces had on all occasions a lyne of communication. His Excellency heareing that his men slaine in attempting the island [12](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note012.html')) were soe vsed, after quarter, hee therfore sent a trumpetter into Lymbrick to inquire of it, and vntill he were satisfyed therein suspending the treaty.


Fryday, 27. The Major-Generall returned to the head quarters from Waterford, bringing to us 2500 men, new recruits there lately landed. Then also did wee heare of 2000 men more comeing out of England, and that there was landed at Waterford £4000 and 4000 arms. There came to the army 10,000 from Waterford.

*The Diary is here resumed after the chasm at page 241, ante.*


July.[*gap: blank*] safely conducted thither by him into the city. And whereas Colonell Sankey was within 2 miles of that party of Dwyer's or diverting him, there was a prisoner of ours released by O Dwyer, who going to Colonell Sankey told him that Fitzpatrick was marched away, it being hoped he would immediately follow him (Fitz Patrick being the principall by him looked after.) But Collonel Sankey understanding withall that Collonel O Dwyer was so neare, he fell into his quarters unlocked for, killing many and dispersing the whole party with the losse of the most of their armes. O'Dwyre himselfe escaped narrowly and thereby was that designe by the goodnesse and providence of God disappointed. Captain Walch, an active rebell on whom they in Limerick much depended for assistance, was there taken and this day brought to the head quarters, by Collonel Sankey. This day we heard of our losse of Karrigahilt, *in* Thomond, taken from us by Col. Roch. This night, about 11 of the clock, a flame of fire passed over Limerick, giving that light by which one might reade. It moved from the north-east, continuing about halfe a quarter of an hower.


Friday, *July* 18. By the last intercepted letters out of Limerick, the enemy in Conaught being invited to a speedy conjunction for relieveing of that place and David Roch and Murtogh Bryon, with theire forces in Thomond, haveing taken our garrison

p.245




of Carrigahilt, proceeding to attempt on the rest of our garrisons in the county of Clare, theire being no considerable party of ours in that county for opposing them; therefore was it resolved at a councell of warre this day that a considerable party should bee sent speedily into the county of Clare for dispersing those there in a body and for preventing that conjunction with Ferrall and the rest out of Conaght on which the besieged so much depended and for securing those of our garrisons in that county.


Saturday, *July* 19. His Excellency with the Lieutenant-Generall marched from the leagure, with about 2000 foote and 12 troupes of horse and 8 troopes of dragoones, into the county of Clare, according to the resolution the day before taken. The Major-generall comaunded here. This day we heard of a party of Vlster men coming into the county of Clare for joyning with Roch and Bryan. The Major-Generall removed the head quarters to the other side of Singland beyond the chappell, putting into the fort part of Collonel Stubbord's Regiment.


Lords Day, 20. By letters from the Lord of Broghill was certified that Muskery was advanceing, being 2500 foote and 700 horse, and that he intended a conjunction with FitzPatrick's forces, and by force or diversion to make way for the reliefe of Limerick, expecting probably the concurrence of the Thomond forces. This his letter was by the Major-Generall sent to his Excellency.


Tuesday, 22. His Excellency returned to the head quarters with some horse and foote, leaveing the Lord Generall in Thomond with 7 troopes of horse and 8 of dragoones and 1200 foote, for attending the enemies motions, and for securing our remote garrisons.


Wednesday, 23. The enemy in Limerick sallied with some horse and foote, but they were beaten back, ours both horse and foote readily answering the alarum. Herein by the blessing of God his Excellency escaped narrowly. His Lordship, with other principall officers, were then laying out a new fort when the enemy so sallied, there not being workes or guards betweene them *and* the party so sallying neere them; but God otherwise disposed it, diverting the danger and carrying the enemy another way, they not seeing theire advantages. By letters from the Lord of Broghill was certified his falling into Muskery's quarters, there killing and taking some and dispersing that party; and by letters from the Lord President of 17th from Gallway was certified the towne was shut upon one side by forts, which finished, he supposed (he said) to passe the river on the other side. We heard that the enemy in Thomond had on the Lt. Genlls advancing burnt Carrigahilt, and that they were gathering theire party to ingage the Lt. Genll

Friday, *July* 25. The Lieutenant Generall returned to the head quarters; of whom we had theise particulars, that he relieved the garrison of Ca*rriga*hilt, besieged by the enemy, and [*gap: illegible*]ing it a place within the land and remote and not easily to be rel*iev*ed, he drew up the garrison and blew up the castle. That in his returne, heareing of the enemyes drawing together at a passe neere Enis, he fell into their quarters, killed many, tooke some prisoners and pursued the rest 3 or 4 miles. Among others was there slaine Connor Brian, of Lymenaugh in the county of Clare, a Coll of horse, the most considerable person in the county, although not acting in cheife, he was much lamented in the countrey, and his cutting off gaue a stop to the proceeding of the enemy and did breake that regiment of horse commanded by him.


Saturday, 26. A woman was taken this night endeavouring to goe into Limerick on Thomond side, she being at the fort there and supposing it belonged to her party. Shee desired to be admitted to the Governors presence, Major Genll O Neale, and being brought into the fort and finding her error she laboured to recall herselfe; but fearing torture (there threatned) she confessed she was sent the day before from Quin in the county of Clare by Coll Roch to tell the Governor of Limerick that on the 27th a party should be about six-mile-bridge (six miles from Limerick) desireing instruction how to order the reliefe there attending him, and ordering her if shee could not passe into Limerick, to returne with what intelligence she observed. This spie was hanged for feare of giving further intelligence.[13](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note013.html'))


Lord's Day, 27. Our provisions growing short so as some weekes past the allowance for bread for the souldiers, but it pleased God, who never has left us in extremities, to send us supplies by sea. Wee heard that Fitz Patrick's party were in the mountaines of Agherlow in the Galtyne, and that by joyning with Muskery they intended releiving them of Limerick on the one side and them of Thomond on the other side endeavouring the like. From Gallway we heard that 1500 Ulsters being admitted into Galway the rest of the Ulster forces were withdrawne thence, and that there were no publique stores in the towne; that we having possessed and in some sort fortified an island on the other side of Gallway, beeing at low water passable, the enemy had fallen on them and taken the place and killed 55 of our men. We heard also that Major Merideth of Sir Thomas Jones his Regt. was sent into Thomond to attend the enemy there. From aboarde we heard that Coll. Popham was with 40 sayle before Dunkirk which is beseiged by the Spaniard by land with 4000 men; that Coll. Blake had taken the Castle of the Isle of Man; and that our forces in Scotland gave a blow to the enemy. This day by letters from the Lord of Broghill, dated the 26th, we heard that with his small party hunting after Musker*y* then come to an head and hastning for a conjunction with Fitzpatrickes

p.247




forces for releeveing Limerick, and his Lordship being by one (it may be purposely imployed by Muskery to that end) told that Muskery was drawne away into Kerry. Thereupon at a place called Disham in the co. of Corke, 2 miles from Clancreene, his Lordship adviseing with his officers, it was resolved not to follow these any further whom they dispaired to find, and by refreshing theire wearied party in some adjoyning quarters to attend the enemies further appearing; and accordingly, drummes beating and trumpets sounding for a march, they unexpectedly discovered the enemy in great bodies at hand and in good order to charge. Muskerie's forces were about 700 horse and 300 dragoones, and 1500 foote, ours but 350 horse and 5500 foote. The hasty coming on of the enemy hardly afforded time for ordering our men. The enemie's word was St. James, on which day, the 25th, they engaged, ours prosperity: the ground on which they drew (called Knockbrackt) was a plaine 3 or 4 miles over without bogge or wood. Muskery encouraged his men to stand to it now (saith he) or never, being confident of successe, trusting in their number; and that day did they show more than ordinary resolution. But it pleased God still to owne us, and after a long and sharpe dispute to give us the better. Of the enemy were slaine about 500, and more wounded. They wanted here their refuge of bogges and woodes, and lost much in so long a pursuite, alsoe all the officers of foote lighted and served in the head of their commands. Muskery escaped by the fleetnesse of his horse. It was contrary to order that any should be prisoners considering theire and our numbers, yet there were taken 1 Lt. Coll., 2 Majors, 1 Capt., 1 Lt., with some others. The great river of Blackewater then overflowing swallowed many of them. Of ours were killed 20, 100 wounded; the Lord of Broghill had his horse shot and himselfe wounded with a pike by his Ex: It was thought adviseable for discovering this to those in Limerick and to shew what theire hopes were of Muskeries assistance to let them understand it by our triumph that this should be a night of triumph by vollies of shott, sounding of drums and trumpets, etc. This being the day appointed by Roch and his party for being at six-mile-bridge, his Ex: comanded out a party of 60 horse for discovering them, but there was nothing heard of them.


Monday, *July* 28. The great wants of the army before Galloway in respect of provisions being represented to his Ex: it was ordered that a proportion of our store should be sent to them by sea. Coll. Sankey this day marched from us with ii troupes of horse and dragoones for following Fitz patrick, who was said to be gathering in order to a conjunction with Muskeries scattered forces. This day we heard that Sir Theo. Jones was come out of Westmeath in Conaught with some forces, and that the 27 instant he would be at Loughreagh with about 100 horse and dragoones there expecting orders from his Ex.


Tuesday, 29. Orders were sent to Sir Theo. Jones that he should hinder all he might Ferall's conjunction, and his Ulster forces with the forces of the co. of Clare, that 



---

p.248




thereby neither his Ex. before Limerick, nor the Lord President before Galloway should be disturbed in theire worke, and to that end his residence at Loughreagh was thought convenient as answering the enemies motions either way, that if Ferrall were passed by already into the co. of Clare and if the Lord President could not spare any considerable forces, then Sir Theo. Jones should march to Thomond side of Killalow to be there and from thence strengthened by Jones sent by his Ex. and to expect further orders from his Ex.


August; Friday, 1. Wee heard that Fitz Patricke had surprised our garrison of Melik on the Shannon about 4 miles from the Birh. That there was not so much as a sentry found awake: and that all in it were put to the sword, the governor only excepted. By letters from the Commissary Generall, of the 29 past, from Galloway was certified that a garrison being received into the towne, the rest of the fresh forces were drawen away towards Ballin and Conge in Conaught; that there designe was supposed for relieving Limericke; that Sir Theo. Jones, with 12 troopes of horse and dragoones, was there falling into the co. of Clare, following David Roch and his party; that this side of Galloway was shut up with 3 forts, 13 redoubts, which were almost defenseable, and that Coll. Russells regiment was to be therein quartered; that Clanricard was in the feild, and that Ferrall was governor of the Vlster armie and Phillip Mac Hugh O Rely assistant to him. Wee heard also that the enemy had a designe upon our garrison of Nenagh in lower Ormond; that the 30th past about 500 foote, and 3 troopes of horse had over night placed themselves comodiously neere the Castle intending on the letting downe the bridge next day to fall into the place; that by speciall providence of God, he watching over us when we sleepe and diverting evills which we see not, Capt. Ayres returning toward the head quarters from Galloway, ferrying over at Portumny, and about breake of day appeared neare Nenagh, the enemy discovering him ranne away, supposing his forces were more then indecde they were whereby the place was preserved.


Lords Day, *August* 3. Some of the inhabitants out of Limerick to escape ferried out on Thomond side; some were slaine and the rest back. By a letter from ours before Galloway we heard of the Commissary Generall takeing Menlogh, a castle near Galloway; that the souldiers being 4 were prisoners of war, officers at mercy; that Fitzpatrick about Melick became numerous by many out of Conaught repaireing to him; that Dungan and Ferrall were labouring a conjunction; that Sir Theo. Jones was attending Fitz Patrick; that the Lord President having settled the workes before Galloway intended to draw off towards Athlone for attending the enemies motions. This day his Ex. by a dispatch to the Lord President of Conaught certified him what by intelligence he understood of the enemies designes, that they intended the sending 500 horse to joyne with the Clare forces, who were about 2000 foote, that by them intending the reliefe of Limerick; and that the forces of Conaught were principally designed for ingageing him the Lord President. That therefore Collonel Hewson was ordered to draw downe with his forces towards Athlone and further



---

p.249




into Conaught as occasion should be for assisting the Conaught army. By letters from Birh we heard that Drunme maneghan in lower Ormond was taken by the enemie; also that they had surprised Calohill, and had murdered the Lord Colvell, the governor.


Monday, *August* 4. We intercepted letters from Limerick desireing supplies; also some going into Limerick from Coll. Roch to the Governor promissing within 5 nights to be neare with reliefe. This letter was dated July 31st, and that the same night there should be a signe given by him from Glanne grosse, a mountain in Thomond towardes Limerick. We thereupon strengthened our guards towards Foybee passe with more horse and dragoones. We understood also of more forces and moneyes landed at Waterford, and more expected; the Scotch rout was also confirmed.


Tuesday, 5. We begun our worke near Foybee passe; also more forces were sent for reenforceing the guard on Thomond side of the towne.


Wednesday, 6. Collonel Sankey with his party came to the head quarters. Collonel Ingoldesby with a considerable party of horse and dragoones was commanded out towards the 6 mile bridge for discovering the enemy said to be in a body in the co. of Clare.


Thursday, 7th. We heard that the treasure landed at Waterford was £50,000; that there were brought thither 500 barrels of powder, 6000 barrels of wheat, 7000 muskets by the care and sollicitation of Capt. Vernon, and that a vessell with wheat and rye of 200 tunnes was coming to the leagure; and for particulars of the Scotch rout before mentioned, we heard that there were of them 2000 slaine and 500 taken prisoners; we heard also that 5 troopes of horse and 1000 foote of the enemy were gathered at Agerthlow about Cullen, and that Capt. Godfrey had fallen into their quarters and killed 20 and tooke 100 horse and armes from them. The Lieutenant Generall riding this day from the leagure to Loghgurre with only 4 horse, having ordered a party of horse to attend him and expecting them to follow him, he set forward, but haveing by a Scout timely discovered about 30 of the enemyes horse ready to fall on, he retyred, and they pursuing 2 miles, but by the blessing of God escaped that danger to the great joy of the army. This night by vollies of shott we triumphed for our victory in Scotland, the particulars whereof were now brought to us. By some out of Limerick we heard of the sicknesses there encreasing, 24 buried in a morning; that they wanted great shot, and for supplying of small shot they had untiled the Earle of Thomond's house. Out of Thomond we heard that the 5th instant Coll. David Roch and Murtogh O Bryan with their forces, about 2500, marched from Ennis to Downemoyhill between the 2 counties of Clare and Galloway; that this day they intended to be at Feakeill; that yesterday they had sent to enquire of Fitz-Patrickes condition and posture, and what side of the Shannon he was on.

p.250




Out of Conaught we heard that Coll. William Burke with 3000 foote beside horse, had 3 daies before marched from the co. of Mayo to Tuam in the co. of Galloway; that there 3 other parties about Castle Barry, intending a conjunction, and that Fitz Patrick had driven a prey of cowes over the Shannon to Melocke. Coll. Ingoldesby returned with his party being sent to discover the enemy, certified his Ex: that he was informed that Coll. Roch and Coll. Bryan had marched lately from Ennis to Downemul [*gap: illegible*] and [*gap: illegible*].


September. At our leaving our quarters this day we left a troupe of horse who with the foote and dragoones of Cloghanaboy were to secure a boate with provisions and sicke men untill the next tide, which being on ground through negligence had been otherwise in danger of the enemy in Clare Castle. This day a party of horse and dragoones in our new garrison of Clonrone on the other side of Clare Castle appearing before Clare, the enemy sallied in number about 150, ours retiring for advantage, and the enemy pursuing, we charged them and killed and tooke about 40, among whom was Capt. Lalor, who charged Coll. White, (late Governor of Clare) for conferring with his Ex. (Aug. 25). In this the Castle of Clare found what they might after expect of those our new garrisons, their neighbours. By orders from his Ex: this party quartered on Thomond side of the flote bridge.


Friday, 5. We passed the flote bridge, the foote quartering apart from the rest of the army untill further orders. In this expedition was our party before Limerick secured from the attempts of the enemy, and the hopes of the beseiged at present disappointed as to supplies from theirs on this side; thereby was the enemy in the co: of Clare dispersed, and many persons therein considerable brought under contribution who till then held out, and either would not or durst not by reason of the enemies power submitt to us; and by it had we the advantage of placing convenient garrisons in that county where was laid a force of about 500 horse and dragoones, and as many foote, for answering all motions of the enemy there, and for repressing the oppression of the country by those in Clare Castle, and for securing our contributions [*gap: illegible*]ining intelligence as oc*casion sho*uld require, which was [*gap: illegible*] those respects very consid[*gap: illegible*]. At a [*gap: illegible*] this day it was debated [*gap: illegible*] of foote now marched [*gap: illegible*] a comaunded party should be ordered, whether to be disposed into their respective regiments. It was resolved that they should holde as they were (comaunded by Coll. Stubbards), and to encampe apart as a loose party, ready to answer all occasions. 2dly, Whether this party should be sent to Galloway for that service, it was resolved in the negative, the worke here being conceived the principall, and it being necessary that there should be a force at hand ready for opposeing any thing to be by the enemy attempted on either hand of us. It was farther debated whether our workes before this place should be in way of approaches which was for

the present by the major part not thought convenient, but that the lines begun from fort to fort should be finished.


Monday, *September* 8. September. His Excellency went this day to Bunratty, belonging to the Earl of Thomond, which lying on the Shannon was conceived fit to be fortified. There was laid Captain Preston with his troope of horse and a foote company. This place was very convenient for baking and making and laying up provisions for the army and other garrisons thereabout. Some labouring to passe out of Limerick were by our guards on Thomond side met withall and putt to the sword. A party of the enemies horse commanded by Lt. Coll. Fitzgerard doing much hurt in [*gap: blank*] in the co. of Corke were the 21st past by a small party of ours drawen together out of Corke and Youghall slaine and wounded, and 500 cowes and some prisoners rescued. Soone after night fall was a torch or fire put out on the top of the highest tower in Limerick given as a signall to those from whom they expected releife.


Tuesday, 9. Coll. Sankey with his party and with the treasure coming by land from Waterford came this day to the head quarters.


Wednesday, 10. We heard that Collonel Bourke was come into the county of Clare for raising forces there. They gave it out that Clanricard had dismissed his army for 15 dayes. Thus were the country reports, but by letters of the 5 instant to his Ex: from the Comissary Generall then about Athlone, it was to this purpose certified, that Clanricards party, being then become co[*gap: illegible*] was about Ballilege [*gap: illegible*] *Conau*ght side of the Shannon that [*gap: illegible*] the Comissary Generall and Coll. Hewson [*gap: illegible*] appointed to attend them marching toward them, Clanricards whole party dispersed notwithstanding great advantages of places almost inaccessible; that Coll. Bourke fled into Conaught with the party of that province, and was by ours pursued 12 miles; that Dungan with the Leinster forces fled into the Kings Co: whom he, the Comissary Generall, and Sir Theo: Jones was then pursuing; that the Ulster forces ran into their owne country not farre of; that Clanricard with the Earls of Castlehaven and Westmeath had by boate at Ballilege slipt to James Towne in the co. of Letrym, and that ours were possessed of the castle of Ballilege, wherein were placed 50 musqueteers. It is a place of good consequence being the onely passe on the Shannon between Athlone and Jamestowne.


Thursday, 11. We were certified of Coll. O Dwyer's and the other rebels in the co. of Tiperary drawing to a generall rendevouz at a place called Glangarow, where Muskery was expected to meete him.


Friday, 12. Coll. Sankey, with 7 troopes of horse and 4 of dragoonos, was sent from the army to attend that enemy.

By some this day come out of Limerick we understood of the factions there, occasioned by their wants encreasing. This moved his Ex: to resolve on preparations for force, and taking advantages of such distractions, and in order thereunto ordered approaches to be made, and ladders to be prepared, and places fitted for battery.


Saturday, *September* 13. This day we had by returnes of our spies and otherwaies confirmations of these gatherings mentioned; particularly that Coll. O Dwyer had 600 horse and 1500 foote rendevouzed at Cullenagh, and that Muskery with his horse was expected all in order to the reliefe of Limerick. This night was a fire shewd in Limerick as formerly (the 8 inst).


Lords day, 14. This night was the like fire shewed in the same place. Some attempts to breake out on Thomond side of the towne, being by our guns covered, were forced backe, the [*gap: illegible*] some passed by us.


Monday, 15. Captain Godfrey, of Coll. Sankey's regiment (a very active officer), and Capt. Cuffe with his troope of dragoones were set upon by 300 of the enemies horse at disadvantage, and being overpowered ours were routed, 13 were slaine, 22 taken besides the officers.


Wednesday, 17. We had intelligence that 3 troopes and some foot of the enemy lay between Cullen and the Abbey of Owney toward Limerick; also that 8 troopes and 15 companies with colours were in the west end of the Galtynwoods, where was theire gathering. By one come out of Limerick we heard that (the 12 inst), it was an assembly in the city debated to treate with us; 2 parts of 3 were for a present treaty, but the rest being, although the fewer, yet the more leading (countenanced by their factious clergie, and the souldiery) prevailed so as that for 14 daies from that time they should forbeare treating in that time expecting reliefe. We heard also that there had beene a plot laid for betraying of Clonmell, which in the discovery of it was prevented. It was informed that Coll. O Brien was that night before within 5 miles of Kilaloe with 500 foote stript (as their manner is when they are upon some nimble and sodaine designe). Thereupon was Capt. Allen (Adjutant Generall of the horse) sent that night with 200 horse and 300 nimble foote towards the place where they might probably be found; but this proved a false allarum, our party returning without discovering any enemy, but in a wood they found a new leather bagge with about 20 pound of good powder.


Thursday, 18. We received intelligence that the Lord Broghill attending Muskerie's motions and thereupon advancing with his forces, Muskery retired and disperst. That the Lord of Broghill was burning Muskeries country in Carbry in the co. of

Corke, that on Coll. Sankeys advancing Coll. O Dwyer and the rest of that party dispersed also. Their designe so failing for relieving Limerick they now comforted themselues with hopes that Limerick would hold out a great part of the winter, and that ours before it must be distressed with want of forrage and not able to last out a winters siege. It was [*gap: illegible*] speech of one of the towne souldiers from the wall to ours that we laboured to beate them out with bomb-shells (so they called our mortar-shot), but they would beate us away with snow-balls. But for both hath his Ex: had fully provided us in the leagure by the bringing in and storing up of forrage in good proportions, and by building of convenient houses in our severall forts, where I suppose our abiding would be much better to many then elsewhere will be theire winter quarters. Muskery had also much comforted himselfe and his party, by hopes of the successe of the Scots King's being then in England concerning [*gap: illegible*].[14](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note014.html'))


October *27*. By letters out of Conaught we found that our garrison of Ballilege on the Shanon, taken by ours the last moneth (mentioned Sept. 10), was delivered to the enemy upon summons, for which some were to be accomptable. The enemy burnt the castle and deserted it. We then also received Clanricards summons to the Sherives of the respective counties for a Generall Assembly at James Towne in the county of Letrim on the 6 of the next moneth for the reasons therein expressed which summons is in these words:
 

> 
> After our hearty comendations: The last Generall Assembly held at Lough Reagh having adjourned unto the 6 day of November next, which through eminent occasions and at the request of the officers of the army hath beene appointed sooner, but by reason of slenderness of apparance and power of the enemy was disappointed from concluding any thing upon the weighty affaires they had to debate, and adjourned unto the said day first appointed. We have thought fit therefore to renue and appoint the meeting of the said assembly at James Town upon the said 6 day of November next at 10 of the clock in the forenoone. And do hereby pray and require that you will under your owne hand and seale return unto the said Generall Assembly at the time and place aforesaid either the former persons returned from the co: of Gallway and Corporations therein or 2 other able and lawfully elected persons by the inhabitants of every burrough of the said co: there to sit and vote in all matters to be debated by the said Assembly; and if the power of the enemy will not permitt such Generall meetings, you are to cause the said election to be made and returned in the best manner you may, and to give notice unto the persons by you to be returned as aforesaid not to faile in the said hower. The rather that we have to communicate unto the said Assembly as well a dispatch lately received by us of a transaction made and concluded with the Duke of Loraine for the releife of this Kingdome, as also severall matters relating to and concerning the said agreement and other matters of much importance to his

Four of the Limerick Commissioners being detained as hostages the other 2 were sent back into the city for reporting the conclusion made with them. His Ex: now recalled those of ours sent into the towne on the cessation, by whom wee were given to understand that some principall officers within had on Thursday last at night possessed themselues of John's Gate, turning 2 guns there on the city and reserving that port for us to be delivered to us if by the malignant party within the treaty were hindered, declaring that if this day all were concluded they would deliver up the place unto us. This was altogether without our knowledge and this hastened the conclusion of the businesse more then did our batteries or force intended, which (we after found) would have beene an obstinate resistance very difficult and hazardous to us. Thus had God without us and without our knowledge prepared our way for us, in a way more to his glory and the good of his servants. According to the articles we tooke possession of John's gate and of the Milne towre this day.


*These Articles, imperfect in the Clarendon MS., are here riven from A Letter from the Lord Deputy-General of Ireland upon the Surrender of Limerick, 1651. See ante, p. 241.*

Tuesday, *October* 28th. Out of the co: of Clare was thus certified: That Coll. Murtogh O Brien and Coll. Bourke lay at Balliturry; that theire forces were 1600 foote and 250 horse; that Coll. David Roch [*gap: illegible*] and that we had garrisoned towne of Inchinglin in Thomond. Out of Kerry we heard that the Lord of Muskery had letters from Clanricard concerning the Duke of Loraine; that there upon he tooke boate and hastened to Gallway where Clanricard was. At a Councell of warre it was this day debated and voted (1) that part of the army should before further service. 2. That that part of the army should march into the co: of Clare to fortifie the towne of Enis, and thence to march to Gallway if it should be found necessary according as should be the returne from the Lord President of Conaught to his Ex: letters to that purpose. His Ex: ordered the forces to be quartered in Limerick and in the quarters about Cashel, and the remnant of this army being 21 companies and [*gap: blank*] troopes of horse and dragoones to be for the marching party. His Lordship also ordered that party of our workes towards Limerick to be slighted and after the whole workes as it should be necessary.


Wednesday, 29th. This day the enemy marched out of Limerick about 1200, and, according as their interests led them, some went into the co: of Clare, some toward Muskery, and others towards their party in the co: of Tiperary. We found there 3770 armes, 83 barrels of powder, 3 tuns and a halfe of match, 23 barrels of shot, and 34 guns, of which 8 brasse and 2 of those demy cannons; we found there also pioneers tooles, backs, brests and head peices to a considerable number.

Major Generall Hugo O Neale, the late Governor of Limerick, did meete his Excellency at his entrance into the towne, and being one of the excepted persons there rendred himselfe prisoner, it being supposed by many he would have shifted away from us[16](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note016.html')); nine others of the excepted persons were then secured, the rest being then either concealed or escaped. At a Councell of warre at Limerick was this day debated how those excepted persons[17](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note017.html')) already in our hands should be disposed. Of them 5 were voted to suffer. Hugo O Neale, the late Governor (supposed by his letters and all transactions with us to have beene principall in the obstinate resistance given, as also for being to the Governor of Galway in like case exemplary), Sir Geff. Galway (a principall incendiary), Sir Richard Everhard (one of the rebels Supreame Councell from the beginning of the rebellion, and holding out notwithstanding the favors shewed him by his Ex: the Lord Lt. during his Lordships residence heere), Jeffrey Baron (a principall instrument in the holding out of Waterford against us, and acting here accordingly and professing his malignancy against us to the uttermost) and Dr. Higgins, a phisitian (a dangerous person, active in rebellion, their powder maker and mony coyner.)


Thursday, *October* 30. Coll. Warden with 6 troopes was sent from us to Enis in the co: of Clare there to attend the coming thither of the army and to assay what might be done by treaty for gaining the strong castle of Clare. This day the Bishop of Emly *O'Brien* and Major Genll Purcell and Capt. Walsh, a priest, 3 of the excepted persons, were detected.[18](javascript:footNote('E650001-001/note018.html')) The 2 first were executed, being persons very active in the rebellion and particularly in the holding out of Limerick: of them Major Genll Purcell, a Coll of horse in [*gap: blank*] begged his life on his knee, whereas Major Genll Hugo O Neale (the late Governor) shewed himselfe to be of another spirit, as by his letter to some of our chief officers which is here inserted, it being the ground of that favour after shewn him:

I appeale to the judgment and censure of the most [*gap: blank*] and men of best understanding within this city what my behavior hath beene, and with what difficulty and patience I endeavoured the surrender of this place, being satisfied in all humane reason and policy (even from the beginning) that it could not withstand your power. I shall therefore humbly entreat your Honour to take my condition into your serious consideration, that I be not otherwise dealt with then the justice or injustice of my case requireth, which I shall undoubtedly expect from a person of my Lord Deputies honor, and through the intercession of your Lordship, which shall remaine an undoubted obligation never to be unacknowledged by

Alderman Strech, late Major of Limerick, another of the excepted persons, was found out and executed. As others he had vowed the holding out of Limerick during his yeare, or time, of government, and accordingly acted with an high hand towards it.

Friday, *October* 31. The marching part of our army was drawen out and quartered on Thomond side of Limerick not farre from the towne. His Ex: removed out of his field quarters into Limerick.


November. Saturday, 1. The Lt. Generall marched with the army into the co: of Clare. His Ex: staid in Limerick for a time for ordering affaires there. That the late Governor of Limerick's letter mentioned professing his desires and endeavours for the surrendering the place from the beginning being after testified by other circumstances, his condition was this day againe taken into consideration and the former vote concerning his execution with the rest was recalled.


Lord's day, *2.* Coll. Warden (sent before into the co: of Clare) this day summoned the Castle of Clare. Hereunto was the following answer returned:


> Sir,
> I can hardly beleue that the Governor of Limerick was brought to such low conditions as you make mention of in your letter.

Monday, 3. This day the Lord President of Conaught came to the heade quarters at Limerick. His Lordship certified us how impossible a thing it was to attempt at this time the shutting up of Galway on the other side: 1. That the bridge prepared for the river at Galway could not be cast over so to passe the water, the enemy having fortified the other side against us. 2. That the marching from Galway about the Lough by the way of Conge to the other side of Galway was above was above 60 miles. 3. That at the entrance of the passage aboue the Lough at Conge (being a passage betweene two Loughs about halfe a mile over) lay Clanricard with 3000 foote. 4. That the Castle of Aghanure would oppose our passing the river by boats in the ordinary way after our entring into Couaught. 5. That therefore we were to march 16 miles about, and in the march to passe 8 rivers, the least of them not passable if any raine should fall, and thereby might our army be shut up within waters. 6. That the way from Cong to Aghanure was such that horses could be only led, and from Aghanure to Galway (12 miles) they could not be led, besides that all the

country had neither corne nor grasse at this time of yeare, all being now destroyed by the enemie quartering there, and so our foote must march without our horse, and all provisions and amunition carried on our souldiers backs onely. Therefore was the marching of the army this way laid aside for the present.


Tuesday, *November* 4. The Lieutenant-Generall coming before Clare Castle it was at a councell of warre debated whether it had beene adviseable to summon or attempt the strong Castle of Clare. The strength of it would make a seige or a storme equally dangerous, considering the time of the yeare and the strength of the place not short of any that we had to deale withall appearing by description of the place and the mappe of it before given. A refusall on a summons would be tending to Carigaholt in the co: of Clare on the Shannon, which was to be now looked after, and the place had beene already summoned by Coll: Warden, and the time passed wherein an answer should haue been given as if not inclining to a surrender. In this difference of opinions it pleased God to encline us to a second summons from the Lt. Generall, which was this day sent, and God thereupon ordered the delivering of the place contrary to our expectation or hopes. The conditions of surrender are as followeth:
 

> 
> 
> > 
> > 1. That the Castle and all places of strength within the same with all the armes, amunition, stores, and other utensils of warre (except heerafter excepted) shall be delivered up to such as shall be appointed to receiue the same without imbezlement or spoile by 8 of the clock tomorrow morning, being the 5 of November.

This day the place was delivered according to the Articles and comitted to Coll. Sadlers government, and in his absence to Lt. Coll. Fowkes of his regiments. There marched away of the enemy about 230. We found there 8 barrels of powder, 70 bundles of match, 2 barrels of bullets, some old unfixed armes, with provision of meale and corne, etc.; also a small iron peece mounted on the workes, and heere we recouered our morter-peece and shels (about 23) and our 2 guns (one a cannon of 7 the other a demie cannon) with their shot, about 60 which had beene lost as is before mentioned, July 5.


Wednesday, *Nov.* 5. This day was at Limerick kept a day of praise and thankesgiving to God for his goodness to us in deliuering to us this citie after so long a seige like unto which was never any in Ireland holding out 5 months from the 30 June to the 29 of October, and taking up the greatest part of this yeares worke with this army. God's time is the best time; in this (as in all other things concerning us) we found it so. 1. Considering the strength of the place, haveing in itselfe (within and without) walls and workes necessary and sufficient for defence. Indeed that part of the wall intended to be by us battered affoorded advantage to the worke above any other part of it; yet haue we since found that our attempts there (had they proceeded) might haue beene little lesse then desperate. 2. Considering the number of the defenders the city bands were accounted little lesse then 2000, to whom were added 1200 foote and horse drawen in thither they [*gap: illegible*] the other commanded by [*gap: illegible*] well experienced [*gap: illegible*] Generall Hugh O Neile [*gap: illegible*] of whom we to [*gap: illegible*] proofe formerly at [*gap: illegible*] Clonmell upon [*gap: illegible*] less [*gap: illegible*] advantages. 3. Considering that all (or most) of both theire militias were as one man united against us, untill the holy God himselfe pointed out and prepared for us, 1. By his owne hand of visitation heavy on those within of whom 8000 by [*gap: illegible*] were so swept [*gap: illegible*]. By removing the then Major (Alderman Strech) comanding the city militia, and by his malignancy hardning them and others unto an obstinate resistance untill the 6 of October (the time by their charter limited for electing another in his place), and who was (if not affected yet) not so disaffected to us. 3. In the divideing first the city militia from the other, and after gaining on the other also, some of the principall officers appearing for deliuering up a port to us if a speedy conclusion were not made as hath beene declared. If it be thought that want of provisions enforced for us the surrender of the place, so indeed it ranne in our intelligence; and though it appeared to those of the meaner sort daily resorting to us, who spake as they found it, many of them being pincht with wants in that kind.

And as a prudent way this might moove with us to proceed as wee did, rather expecting then at aparant hazards forcing the place. But we now finde the stores in the city more then were reported or more then the owners would before have acknowledged, and much more then would have consisted with the well being (if with the being) of our army to sit by it at this season untill these should haue been consumed.


It was God alone who in his wisedome and goodnesse ordered our worke and our way and our time and all for us. Had it been done at first in the full strength of our army, or had it beene done after by battery or forces (an hopefull way in the eies of many) then had our corruptions stept in for part of ye praise which now appeareth Gods onely, it being done in our weaknesse (our number being diminished by sicknesse) and [*gap: illegible*].
