p.89


1. I had this thought awhile ago,
  
'My darling cannot understand
  
What I have done, or what would do
  
In this blind bitter land.'
2. And I grew weary of the sun
  
Until my thoughts cleared up again,
  
Remembering that the best I have done
  
Was done to make it plain;
3. That every year I have cried, 'At length
  
My darling understands it all,
  
Because I have come into my strength,
  
And words obey my call.'
4. ---

p.90


That had she done so who can say
  
What would have shaken from the sieve?
  
I might have thrown poor words away
  
And been content to live.
