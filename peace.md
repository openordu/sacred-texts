1. Ah, that Time could touch a form
  
That could show what Homer's age
  
Bred to be a hero's wage.
  
'Were not all her life but storm,
  
Would not painters paint a form
  
Of such noble lines,' I said,
  
'Such a delicate high head,
  
All that sternness amid charm,
  
All that sweetness amid strength?'
  
Ah, but peace that comes at length,
  
Came when Time had touched her form.
