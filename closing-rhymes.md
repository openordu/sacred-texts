1. While I, from that reed-throated whisperer
  
Who comes at need, although not now as once
  
A clear articulation in the air
  
But inwardly, surmise companions
  
Beyond the fling of the dull ass's hoof,
  
—Ben Jonson's phrase—and find when June is come
  
At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof
  
A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,
  
I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,
  
Those undreamt accidents that have made me
  
—Seeing that Fame has perished this long while
  
Being but a part of ancient ceremony—
  
Notorious, till all my priceless things
  
Are but a post the passing dogs defile.
