### Dialogue of Silvynne and Peregrynne: Author: H. C.


### Prefatory Note


This lost work of Elizabethan literature is a major source on the Nine Years War, 1593-1603. Its unusually detailed account of County Offaly in the late 1590s provides new evidence about Gaelic society. It was probably written by Hugh Collier, a messenger and spy in government service. This work exists in a unique manuscript copy amongst the Irish State Papers at the Public Records Office, Kew, London.


I have transcribed the text below as the orthography and punctuation appear in the original. The transcription has been checked by my colleague, Kenneth Nicholls. We are working on a fully-annotated, modernized edition of the text for publication in the near future.

So right honorable for myne owne parte, I must say as Aeschynes, the condisciple of Socrates said to his master, who seeing many of his ffellowes, present him with verry rich gifts and he himself so poore, that hee was not Able to yielde him any whit at al, cam to him and saide, that he had no other gift, that was of pryce but his dutiefull service duringe lyfe which remayned at his comaunde.

### The ffirst Booke, entreateth of


diuers outradges comited in the Kinges


County, from the latter end of the harvest


1597 vntill march next ensuinge viz:

**Silvyn**
I am meightely deceaued, but yonder walketh my frende Peregrynne, to whom I will drawe nere, for he hath bene missinge, full one yeare and a half, and assured I am that he hath not spent so greate a tyme in vayne. God save you gentle brother Peregrinne, In what clymat of the worlde haue you made your abydinge., your frends haue bene greately discontented, and much grieved was myself lykewyse, of your longe discontynuance, but now I haue caught you once againe, you may not so lightly departe my companie, before I haue sownded the cause of your absence., and therefore I pray you tell me where you haue spent your tyme, for you must thinck you are not a litle wellcome unto me.


**Peregryn**
My good brother, I am as glad to see you in health, as any frende whatsoeuer that I haue now in the worlde, and to be brief with you, I arryved not past two howers sithence at Sprignolls shopp, where I made greate enquirye for you, and after I was tryumded I went to paules, then to the Exchaunge, and now I thanck God, I haue met hym at Westminster whom I honour with my harte: and whereas your desyer to knowe where I haue spent my tyme this yeare and this half, you shall understand, that I haue bene in Ireland.


**Silvyn**
In Irelande man[brvbar] Oh[brvbar] what a country of wrath is that it hath not the addicion of the sillable Ire in vayne, but I pray you tell me., where and how haue you spent your tyme in that land of trouble., and what is the best newes from thence.

p.2


{folio 284v}**Peregryn**
My chiefest abydinge, whilest I was there, was in Aphaley (a parcell of the Kinges County.


**Silvyn**
Why[brvbar] the inhabitantes there, be for the moste English as I haue harde, and men of good accompte.


**Peregryn**
So they are, for the moste parte, but some of them as honest men (as your oulde acquayntaunce Jherome Son/uher, who was throwne ouer the barre for forgery.


**Silvyn**
A Shame take them for theire labour (but it maketh no greate skill, for there are men of all sorts good and badd, but I pray thee deliuer, some of that countrie newes.


**Peregryn**
I am contented, to satisfie thy request, towching such accydentes as haue happened in the Kinges County, duringe my aboade there (myself beeing an eye witnes of many calamyties there happeninge, especially to the poore English and theire adherentes, And first will I begynne, with one Sir Edwarde Harbert of a place called the Durrough.


**Silvyn**
I remember not longe sithence, I saw him a sutor at the Court and had verry good countenance of her maiestie, beinge mightely befrended with the best sorte and especially with the Erle of Pembrooke, and Doctor Harbert, one of the masters of the requestes.


**Peregryn**
It is even the verry same gentillman, and god knoeth her maiestie hath to few such in the realme of Ireland (for if shee had the greate devill of the North (the traitor Tyroane I meane) had not continved his malice so longe, But now to the matter, Aboute the ende of harvest 1597 in cometh that graceles bud Bryan Reogh from the Northerne Lucifer (or Belzebub if you will) I much care not, and he lyke a myninge devill, with a nomeber of spirittes

from all fower partes of the worlde to hym assembled withowt either descry, encounter, Let or stay, as though he with his wicked Crewe had come invisable. Arryveth harde by that serviceable knight Sir Edwarde Harbert, then being at Durrough, in the night tyme, and hete there so closely, that before the good knight was once aware, they were lyke to haue intrapped himself, his lady, their children and servauntes, with castle, house, goods and all. ffor first hearing the Alarum in the towne, and to hym seeminge but some ordynary matter befallen, lyke a stealth comonely in those countries happeninge, sent owt some of his tryed people, to recouerr any thinge agayne, that in such manner was so taken.) but the master devill of those myning spirittes (shewing himself as cvnninge, as the ould serpent that deceaued Adam by the meanes of Eave: first sent owt some of his flyinge spirittes to provoake a skirmish. And that would not serve, comaunded some of his fyerie legion to play theire partes. Vppon which one Clinton the leader of Sir Edwardes shot issued forthe vppon the setting of some howses on fyer nere adioigning to the castell, all which tyme the M-r Engyner, lay lvrkinge lyke an oulde serpent, vnder a ridge or baurk, not far from the house, to haue surprysed the same if possibly he might, accordinge his masters comission (with the advyse of many other good dishonest hedds I warrant you) Well to be shorte, the good knight, who had formerly tasted of the lyke stratageams mounted to the top of his pyle, from whence he espyed the master Engyner with his darke discyples, ready with open Jawes to haue devoured all, if Clinton had passed neuer so litle farther., wherevppon a retract was cryed (which was done with the losse of V or six men on both sydes.


**Silvyn**
I promis you that knave was bothe hardy, and pollitique, and well frended besydes and I pray you what did hee then.

p.4


{folio 285v}**Peregryn**
When that Invisible Jugler saw, that all his trickes, feictes and conceiptes, toke no small effectes, he then imitate Allexander the greate, in whose meryment Lais the Curtyzen provoaked hym to burne Persepolis, which he presently went in hand with. The rumor whereof beinge spread thorough the army (the nobles and chieftaines with theire companies, thinckinge the fyer to haue happened by some mischaunce, came rrvning with water & other matter to quench the same, but seeinge themperour to further the destruction of so Noble a cittie, with his owne handes, threwe downe theire water, and other matters for help and departed with grief. And so my myninge devill burned all the whole parish of the Durrough, to the greate hurte of the good knight, and his tenantes, a losse of no small reconinge and yet never a personne, rich nor poore, small or greate, came either with help of water, or other matter as aforesaid, to the remedy and quenchinge of the premisses, vntill all was with fyer consvmed.


**Silvyn**
Alas good gentillmean, the more is the pittie that his Lyvinge should ly in such a remoate place., and emongst such vyle neighbours, but I pray you proceed farther, & tell me when this master Engyner will pack him away.


**Peregryn**
After he had performed all at the Durrough as aforesaid he addresseth himself into the harte of the countrie of Phercall, being otherwyse named Omoloyes countre, and there one Donell McArt Omoloy had some small bickeringe with hym. In which skirmish the said Donell was hurte with an enchaunted weapon in the Arme: so that neither he nor his brother Callogh were euer true to her maiestie sithence.


**Silvyn**
Now truely as I remember, you and I, aboute some xxiii yeares agon, were walking in yealde hall, at which tyme there cam thither, An ancient fatherlye gentillman, called Capten Cowlye, in company with Master Browne an officer under the maior of the said

{folio 286r}

 hall, and emongst other talk betwene them, I harde them lament the deathe of one Robert Cowley, who was slayne by some of thoise Omoloyes, at the forte of Phillipstowne, some two yeares before.


**Peregryn**
Now truly brother Sylvynne thee passest for good remembraunce, for the said Robert was slaigne at the forte bridge (by Shane roa Omoloy and his company, being a brother by the father syde unto the said Donell and Callogh., The last of the two (by some witchcraft as I take it) married the widdowe of one Donnell Omoloy a gallant servitieur of her maiesties who was slaigne by the Connors at the Durrough longe sithence, and shee was the eldest daughter of the said Robert Cowley.


**Silvyn**
Seene we haue digressed a litle from Brian Reogh whose daughter was mother, to the said Donell and Callogh.


**Peregryn**
As I haue hard, shee was a sister to a knight called Sir John Tirrell.


**Silvyn**
But I pray the tell the truth, are theire right Tirrelles in that country.


**Peregryn**
Why is that such a matter, there are ould Tirrells and New Tirrelles, a whole countrie full in a county called westmeath.


**Silvyn**
Ould Tirrelles and new Tirrelles[brvbar] I pray you make a destinction of them.


**Peregryn**
I am content to satisfie they request, as nere as I canne, for havinge had some conference with a gentillman of westmeath, towching those

{folio 286v}

 

Tirrelles, he with small intreaty., toulde me, that the ould Tirrelles, came ouer at the first Conquest of Ireland., and were of the kyndred of Walter Tirrell that killed William Rufus, And the new were lyneally discended ffrom James Tirrell, that murdered Edwarde the fifth & his brother (and they came ouer longe sithence the first (of which sept Sir John Tirrell is one who by reasonne of wealth and allyance with the borderers, his awncestors suppressed the ould Tirrelles and beareth rule of them under maiestie.


**Silvyn**
Now I ensuer you there is some hidden mistery in this name, they have bene such untowarrd people for I remember one myself in Quene Maries tyme (called Sir Edmond Tirrell, as meete a companion for bonner in the persecucion of the protestantes, as might be.


**Peregryn**
It apereth you would fayne knowe the Irish phrase of that name: I protest unto you, the said gentillman tould me, they call it in Irish Treealh, which signifieth banished for murder or threasonne.


**Silvyn**
Well brother Peregrynne, I was suer there was some darke meaninge in it, which I am afraid will come to an exchange matter, before it be longe. But what[brvbar] me thinckes we haue bene so far in with the Omoleyes, and the Tirrelles, that wee haue cleane forgotten brian Reogh.


**Peregryn**
A mischief take his sconce for his labour, for after his thanckles paynes taken at the Currough, he taketh vpp his refections in Pharall, Odoynbes countrie, and the borders there aboutes, and passeth by degrees with more favour then feare

{folio 287r}

 

into Leix, where he and his hellhowndes, not as invisible spirittes, but as opn persecutors of the good subiect in those partes, for and on the behalfe of the Antechristian League., conferreth with the bluddy spiritt Owny Omoore, for a supply of some of his followers, and as many of the Connors who maligned the Estate of the English and others of her maiesties good subiectes in Aphaley: which request was with small labour obteigned, for the said Owny. with those Connors & others: not many daies before: who make clayme to that countrie of Aphaley: in passinge through the same, toke such an assay of the swetnes thereof, that they were easely indvced to fight under Lucifers banner. And to further theire busynes the better, there went forth of Aphaley in comepany with them three forstallinge caterpillors, named Comick Oge O Dempsy, Brian O fferrall, and William Mc Cay: a leash of as daungerous vermyn as euer possessed a stoany cave.


**Silvyn**
But me thinckes one conceipt or another, still dryves us away, from endinge with Brian Reogh, a plague take his greatnes, for I rem-ber you and I, saw the miscreant, in the counter, being comitted by one Sir Charles Ocarroll.


**Peregryn**
You say true, but two greate ones, were suters for his enlardgment, the first of them pervayled and the latter reiected, but the service had bene agreate deale better for her maiestie, and the poore Ireland subiect, that he had made his Ultimum Vale at Tybourne.


**Silvyn**
Truly brother you say true, but we English menne, either we cannot, or we will not see, what is

good for the Comon wealth, but if a poore servitieur of our owne countrie birth., should haue bene comitted (yea[brvbar] but for a small fault. The best comforte that he shall haue, is hang him, hange him: well proceede.


**Peregryn**
Well now entreth Brian Reogh agayne, havinge gathered togither a greate nomeber of caterpillers, meete as he thought to goe thorough with his intended villany (accordinge to his oathe anbd promise made to the Traytor Tyroane, so that vppon the last of September 1597, he havinre in his comepany the nomeber of some CCC or fower hundredth reprobates of all sortes, arived into that countrie of Aphaley, with allmoste as greate cvnninge, as he com to the Durrough, withowt either hue and cry made, or blowe gived vntill he cam within half a myle of Phillipstowne, where then lay in garrysonne Capten Henry Cowleys hundredth fote, but yet by the way, he forgot not to enterteigne, Teig Roegh Odoyne, being a whelp of a good kynde, for he is no worse a man, then Shane Oneales daugthers sonne: and in his passinge by Geshill, the Connors in token of a boone voyadge strykes of William Ahaillers headd, because he had spoken blasphemy, agaynst some of their vipoers, Then draweth he on towardes Knockbaleybooy, a towne of Nicholas Tutes, and there my forstallinge companions worke theire pleasures., but yet somewhat before this Master Dempsy came to the towne and tould Lientenant Rushen, that if he woulde take forth some xxtie or xxxtie shot to skirmish with thenemy, he might gall verry many of them, and retourne back agayne in safety (vppon which mocion, and rather rather that the said Dempsy was of credit in that countrie, he was contented to awnswere his request, and therevppon[brvbar] made choyce of his most tryed soldiers, and to encoradge them the better, the said M-r Dempsy bestowed some stoare of sack vppon them, which wyne by gods providence, was the sweetest, that euer they tasted in theire lyves, for that beinge a greate delay, that they went not

forwarde at the first, kept them from destruction, for otherwyse they had either ouerpaste the enemy, by another way, or els met them full in the teeth, (far from relief). And then in most mens judgement had bene all massacred, and the towne burned, (if the forte had escaped, but after they had tasted theire liquor, away went the Lieutenant with his soldiers, the said m-r dempsy and his servaunt accompanyinge them on horsback, who had not marched scarce a quarter of myle, but the enemy was descryed. Vpon which the said lieutenant, seeinge so great a force made an easy retreicte: which the ememy espyinge, threwe away theire mantles and made after him so fast, that they fell in skirmish at a villadge called Clonad belonginge to the aforesaid Tute, which those forstallinge vipers forgot not to fyer, as they had don formerly at his towne of knockbaleyboy, to the gentillmans greate hinderaunce: his losses be accompted to amounte to the some of CCli at the least, besydes his tenants and others. [3](javascript:footNote('E590001-001/note003.html'))


**Silvyn**
I promis you brother, perceaue there be a nomeber of dissemblinge hippocrittes in that countrie, for it apeth, the said m-r dempsies foreknowledge of thenemies strength, and to provoake the said lieutenant and his compay, to goe forth., from the Queens maiesties fforte and towne, to endanger themselues against a multitude: and lay all vppon six and seaven, showed no good meaninge in him, neither the other much to be comended, for his too much forwardnes but god a mercy a cupp of sack, once a mans tyme, thoiugh he neuer meddle with that liquour afterwardes: but I perceaue those forstallinge vipers brake not forthe of theire Cave but to worke an honeste mans woe. But proceede with the skirmish.


**Peregryn**
Now truely there was a whot skirmish, betwene the Lieutenant and the Enemy, yet allthough

p.10


{folio 288v}

 The miscreantes were xv for one: our syde, yet those handfull of soldiers beate them from the high Towne with the slaughter of some six of themeny, and loste no more but one Evans Vaughan, a tall fellow and another soldier hurte, Then they passed aloofe for feare of the greate ordynaunce of the forte, which dismayed them mightely, but yet they burned the moste parte of the subberbs withowt the north gate called beggars bush to the hinderance, and undoinge of many an honest subiect.


**Silvyn**
I perceaue the garrysonne soldiers had much adoe to kepe the forte and towne, from destruction, but where were all your greate knightes and gentlemen of that countrie for me thinckes the verry shewe of them if they had not fought, would haue done much to haue dismayed the Enemy.,


**Peregryn**
I must needes say that the soldiers did what in them lay, for Seriant Phillips skirmished with the enemy at beggars bush, but being overlaied by the caterpillers was driven to retier, and whereas you speake of knightes and gentillmen you shall vnderstand, that an hower after that skirmish at beggars bush, in cometh mr Dempsies brother and some xx or xxxtie kearne and shot with hym (with greate hast and litle speede, as though they had slept all the tyme the enemy was in theire country, and not mynded to follow the vipers, drew towardes mr Phillips, for theire dynners and so returned ouer the bog into theire owne country withowt blow given or taken.


**Silvyn**
Now truly brother if I were to distinguish the abouesaide comepanions, (with Lucyfers crewe, I woulde make litle difference, betwene bothe parties, for the black disciples worke theire mailce openly with swoorde and fyer: and the other

**Peregryn**
After that these broode of vypers passed beggars bush, they devyded theire loose companions vnder diuers leaders, and so went through the hart of the countrie burninge and spoylinge my Archvyper kepinge himself with his mayne battle at harmes (for the rescue of such flyinge spirittes, as he had sente abroade (three or fowerscore of which, came to a farme called Cloneireill, within as myle of the forte, and there thought to haue wrought wonders, for that it was in a manner better then a bare towne but thre it well appered, the difference betwene god and mammon, the good and the bad: for in that place, an ould gentillman named Peter Leicester, with some vii or eight lusty fellowes so tickled my vypers that wnet thither, that well was that devill that coulde fly fastest havinge one of theire best ymbes slayne, with some thre or fower other of the comon sorte and divers hurte besydes, which accident somewhat dismaied the Lucifermen., and from thence they poasted towardes Sir Thomas Moores landes, and there they burned some of his townes, but the greatest losse there, happened to one Donogh O Sherin which was estemed to amunte to some CCth markes: the cause of whose mishappe was, that not longe before., he refused the aforesaid Teig Reogh Odoyne for one meales meate, but it had bene better for him, to haue given him a yeares diet.


**Silvyn**
Now truly brother that was a good ould

To tell the trouthe Sir Thomas Moore was then at Dublin, and Sir Henry Warren, high Sherif, Sir George Cowley, M-r Wakeleys brother with some xxx horssmen made a stande at a place called Tippordalty (Vppon the ende of a togher, being the said Sir Henries lande, and the greatest pece of service that there was done, was an enterpryse perfourmed by the said M-r Wakeleis man, who adventured to ryde ouer the said togher or cauesey, beinge better then a flight shot in length, the Enemy burninge hard by, and so passed to Croghan, And at his retourne., the enemy was on the bog adioyningee to the said togher, and there dicharged a volew of shot at hym, but as god woulde, missed the man and killed the horsse, and yet he lyke a lustie fellowe, escaped from the enemy with his saddle and brydell vnto his comepany: Then some of the flyinge vypers were marching ouer the bog, to haue burned some of Mr Wakeleis land: but were prevented by John Wakeley his brother: for he espyinge there intentes rid form the sherif, with such of his comepany as he had of his owne, and commaunded a nomeber of his brothers tenantes to get vppon to get vppon garrondes, some havinge a stake, a pole or the lyke in theire handes, and so drooped lyke gald fellowes to the top of a hill in view of the Enemy: at which strange and unlooked for shewe, it was no boote to bid my flyinge vipers retyer to their mayne stand.

Well brother it grieued me to the harte, to see the slacknes of those gentillmen, for no doubt, they are men good enough, and such as hathe sene service, and hae bene captens of good desert, but in this poynte they erred greately, for if they had made but a shew as formerly you haue said, vpon some height at a place called Killadurrey, some half myle by north the towne, they shoulde both haue encoraged the soldiers and townsmen, to haue adventured more then they did, driven M-r dempsies men for shame to haue done somewhat, and they themselues haue engaaged all theire straglers, the grownde being champaigne and harde, yea and by your favour, haue made the Archvyper more affraid then his flyinge spiritts were of Mr Wakelies spearemen, for I assured myself, that they woulde all haue fledd back ouer the bog, and then of necessitie must needes haue loste many of their Idle lymbs in the pursuite, for after they had tasted of the oulde gentillmans banquet at Cloneirieff theire march was so timerous, and their lymbs and eies so weary with travaile, and lokinge aboute, that they thought euery bush had bene a man. But when they saw, there appered no let, and for that the day was somewhat spent, they burned the towne at the togher, and so passed ouer the bog to the two heskers, and there made bonfyers at theire willes and pleasures, but were so wearied with travaile by credible reporte, that fiftie able soldiers would haue discomfited them all.

Now truly brother to easy a death indeede, and after they were taken downe (some of them had buriall, better perfourmed a greate deale: then the murthered had who rather should have bene vsed as the good merchant dothe his rennishe wyne, who thincketh it never good nor vendable, except it be ract, but rackinge tyme in Irelande is stale and a torture not to be vsed, agaynst souche vnmeeke harted people aas the Irish is, for the moste parte of theire offences, is but threasonne and high threasonne, for robberies and other owtradges: they are accompted but jeastes.


**Silvyn**
Well brother[brvbar] as I was never in Ireland yet so God willing, and for ought knowe: my purpose is never to come there, but you left a companion behynde you there: that let him be armed with countenance will in a few yeares (be so well furnished with the drosse of that kingdome) that at his last darke voyadge., Cerberus will set hell gates wydes open: when he heareth of his cominge: for his trayne will be greate that will follow his loare. Well haue we done with theise unblessed crew, as yet.


**Peregryn**
In deede brother the party you speake of, so he may haue it, careth not how he dothe come by it. There was another spiritt of that coate, but not of that fraternitie (named Phelim Reogh O Connor) taken by the lorde of Dellvynes men, and after execvted, ads doubty a rebell as the best (and one of the chief of that broode. Many others of that dampnable crew were after taken, kild and hanged, and so after this for the space of three monethes, those that remayned pact into South Leympster, to Ioigne themselues with that archtraytor Brian Reogh.

I would I had as many fat oxen, as he hath bene tyme there, sithence his first departure, then shouldest you see me in Smithfielde, on Friday sellinge fat ware for in this vacant tyme, Donell Mc Art Omoloy, was in the north with his master lucyfer, and then had he his protection agayne, in which the forstallinge vyper was not forgotten to be incerted.

My moste redoubted brother, the greate frendship, that hathe allwaies contynved inviolate betwene vs, from the begynninge of our firste acquayntaunce, vntill the day and date hereof; and now fyndinge my self quyetly seated in the fayer towne of kilkenny: the staple place for all occurrences in these partes happeninge: I coulde doe no lesse, aswell for that my longe contynvaunce in those partes: mooued me thervnto: as hearinge of the ouerthrow and banishment of the graceles O Connors, who all this longe whyle; hathe wrought the rvyne of that most wealthy country: And lastly for that I lately receaued thy letters for my retourne., togither with the newes of those partes, all which if I should haue omitted, I might happely haue fallen into lapse of ingratitude: thy kynde epistle was better wellcome to me then a dozen of ember wiekes, for I haue tasted to much of that costly fare, since the forstallinge vypers, burned me at Clonad in harvest last: and so to the matter.


After that the right honourable the Lorde Lieutenant Generalles goinge from Phillipstowne to Dublin, and Brian Reogh havinge played his pageantes (notwithstandinge his protection (with the slaughter of many of her maiesties good subiectes, yet for all that, it was thought fit, that so evill a companion as hee shoulde not lodge behynde his honour in these partes: his lordship then goinge northwarde, to parlee with the traitor Tyroane, sent him his protection, with comaundement besydes, to repaire forthwith to Dublin: and to attende his honnour: in this expedicion, which he presently did: and after the effectinge of thinges there, he stand a whyle to recreate himself with the Grando diabulo of the northe, vnder whose banner he still fought for all his faier

And when you come within theire shot, fall to the sworde forthwith: this ill councell was not so soone invented but in the same manner or much the lyke presently effected: to the overthrow of some xxxty tall fellowes (whose councell to theire officer was to stand to fight assone as they had discried them, and not to trust such as were faythles, (but his wordes and rash councell prevayled before theires, to his and theire distruction, with the losse of theire apparrell and victuall: yet thery fought it owt to the vttermoste at handblowes, and beinge ouerlaid with multitude sould theire lyves deere, in her maiesties quarrell betwene Athy and Stradbelly.

Then beinge elevated, with this good successe, furnisht his wynde shaken rascalles with the apparell and furniture, that he toke from the soldiers, and so strykes vpp to the borders of Ormonde, where he plaied his pranckes in as good sorte, as in any other place; vppon which that towardly younge gentillman, Capten James Butler, nephew to the Lorde Lieutenant, with his comepany of foote, and some assistaunce of the country, followed the vypers, thinckinge not onely, to haue recouered a prea by the enemy taken, but to haue done some service vppon them; but he lyke companion, haue more trickes in his budget then one, caused his light spirites, to dryve away the prea, whylest he with his moste tryed vypoers, weare seated in ambushe: Now the right worthy gentillman, not mistrusting any such fals measures: neither half Argos eyes aboute him, followed the prea so farre, that he lighted in the middest; betwene the prea and the ambush before he was once aware, and then cvnninge mates gaue an onset bothe before and behynde, agaynst whom that valyant youngling fought verry manfully, with some others aboute him: but the remnant of his people seeinge the Capten engadgt, toke them too theire heeles, one of the best exercyses of that country, where after he beinge soere wounded was taken prisoner with some of their chiefest men aboute him, and many other slaigne; and so not keepinge him longe was released vppon certaine condicions (to me unknowne) vppon the bandes of Sir Charles Ocarroll and others.


After this conflict for avoyding of farther harmes, the Lorde Lieutenant generall, hearinge that one Daniell Spanniagh, a pencioner of her maiesties, and chief seignour emongst the McMurghoes: the ill successor of the greate McMurgho the last Leinsterian kinge., in Irelande (was started from his alleadgiaunce: and not onely a perillous fellowe: but a borderer upon Ormonde thought it most fit, (and the rather to avoynde the Combynacion of those two basiliskes;, once againe to protect the said Brian Reogh and his

Then for that his people shoulde not lye Idle, for feare of catchinge the fever Hurdayne, he addresseth himself towardes Sir Charles Ocarrolles, with some of his trustiest crew., (where a greate Quagge myer met with him, and there was much adoe, with quiveringe and shakinge of *hands/heads* betwene them two; the rest of his sweepstakes went downe into Pherrall, to visit theire oulde ffrendes the Omoloyes, whereby Chaunce, Sir Christener Sct Lawrence his comepany, Sir Edwarde Fitzgerralds, and parte of Capten Henry Cowlies were, And at Balleybooy, some of Sir *(sic)* comepany, and some of Brian Reoghs met togither and stroave who shoulde carry away the bucklers, the kearne seeinge they were stronge enough for them, stoodde to theire tacklinge; bothe sortes takinge the advauntage of some place of strength, but lieutenant Fitzsymmones remembringe himself, what service might be done, by somewhat delayinge the tyme, sent a swift boy, for lieutenant Lyons, and James Philipps Capten Cowlies seriant, to come vnto him with their companies with all expedicion, which accordingly they did vppoin which[brvbar] the kearne fearinge to *(sic)* entrapped toke them to theire heeles, leavinge some of theire spirittes behynde for a witnes they had bene there, and chaced them into the bosome of theire Master Brian. who cam forth to the rescue, but a tall fellow of the soldiers going somewhat to farre: caught some stoare of blowes but yet rescued and recouered; then Brian sent his messenger vnto the officers of the bandes, to signifie

vnto them, that he and his were protected, and therefore his people and himself had wronge., but the officers and soldiers, knowinge to well his knavery, if he had bene better provyded for them) gaue his messenger faier wordes, and so departed aboute theire owne busynes.


Then when the terme of his visitacion was expyred in those partes, and thinkinge it longe that his greate trayne shoulde lye Idle and doe nothinge, drawes towardes, his new companion in harmes Donell Spannyagh, and after some conference had betwene them., they agree to take a prea in the county of washforde. And so beinge some viii or nyne hundreth caterpillers, advaunceth themselues forweardes. (consideringe that Brian Reogh should haue the vawarde, And Donnell Spanniagh should stay in the entraunce of a fastnes vndescryed and not to shewe himself, before he sent him worde or that he saw him distressed: allottinge him his owne people the Cavenaughs, alias McMurghoes, with some of his own spirittes.


Thus havinge given order for all thinges away he addresseth himself with some fyve hundreth in his comepany and rayseth a mighty prey, not farre from Inishcorfy, where Mr Treasuers comepany of foote then lay. with some CCth of the piccardyne soldiers placed in the country thereaboutes: who hearinge the Alarum vppon the gatheringe of the prea, the said three companies, made towardes the cry, and so did Sir Thomas Coakeley and his brother, with many other gentillmen and inhabitantes of the country besides: who lyke valyant people chardged the enemy home And had the slaughter of a nomeber of Brian Reoghes vypers and rescued the prea: but not beinge contented with such good succes, chased the Enemy bothe loose and disorderedly, which that Crafty Engyner espynge., beinge then on horsback, caused a swift foteman, to call in Donell Spannyagh (who cominge in vnlooked for (with his freash cavenaughes: and that in good oder, chardged the soldiers, the country gentillmen and theire people, havinge spent themselues

 bothe in boddy, and want of powder, and other necessaries, and allthough they made what resistance they coulde, Sir Henry Wallopes band of moste valynat and tryed soldiers were there allmoste slaigne, with scome hundreth of pickardyne soldiers, beinge men of greate valure (who soulde theure lyves deerely; Sir Thomas Coakeley had his horse kilde, and his brother Leonarde Coakekey slaigne, with many others of that country besides It was my chaunce to be at Carlogh the same night, that the enemy retourned, who with greate bravery tryumphed, and hade theire protection as it was credibly tould me, sent them that same tyme., so that it *scolleth/stilleth?* not what Iniury they comit against the prince and subiect.


Then vppon the neck of this vpp poasteth Owny O moore, and then he and his seneschalles plaies their fegaries in Leix, that allmoste all the houldes and castelles of that country are in theire owne power., the forte and some few as yet excepted, so that there neddeth a new conquest there (the more pitty if it pleased the lorde.


Now much aboute this tyme vpp cometh John Lystonne; that Trayterous mounsterman, from the north, and what a notable companion he hath bene (all the worlde knoweth, and yet hatched emonge the english, well in the Erle of desmondes warres, as well for comittinge sundry threasones as otherwyse at the murderinge of Englishmen since that country was given, then a greate servitieur under the Traytor Tyroane [7](javascript:footNote('E590001-001/note007.html')), then by him poasted into Spaigne, aboute some honeste busynes., and at his retorne againe vnto him: had in greate estymacion, but not forgettinge his oulde cvnninge slightes, seinge that in the ende, his graunde master mighte happely

And as crainck the traytor Listonne is, as though he were as true a man, as any her maiesty hath in Ireland., (which I knowwe is the leaste parte of his meaninge, but the knave was weary of Oatemeale, and stinckinge butter, in the Northe; beinge full *sumbd/suinbd/swined?* with currant stuffe; quickly atteigned to amende his diet and lodginge. but the villaigne ashameles? and happely made the noble peere belieue that he woulde worke wonders, which god knoweth is no parte of his creede., I ensuer brother my harte turned in my body, when I sawe that shameles murder of her maiesties subiecres, but as the worlde goeth now in Ireland, it is better to be a knave then an honest man., for the first must bee advaunced (in pollycy as the better soorte say, for comittinge any farther villany, and the seconde muste learne to begge, in respect of his to much zeale and honesty.


Then not longe after, the lorde Lieutenant Generall, repaired to Dublin, and Donell Spannyagh beinge somewhat anymated to become infamous after his late gotten victory in the county of Wexforde, combyneth himself, with Feugh McHughes sonne, to make a bravado aboute Saggard, being some Vii myles from Dublin, the which the Erle of Ormonde vnderstanding, drew towardes them with such forceies, as he might make in the Citty, and sent Capten George Greame before to descry, bothe the nomeber of the Enemy, and the place where they were: which he undertooke to doe, now Mr Oliuer Wallop, and other gentillmen to the nomeber of xx or there aboutes, desyrous to goe in comepany

Greames shewinge himself well what he was, but there Mr Wallopp, Capten Gibsone, James nix and others paid for theire to much forwardnes with the losse of theire lyves, which if they had proceeded no farther but to descry, they might haue bene bothe the ocasion of better service and happely haue theire owne lyves, for after the noble Erle came in, he had the slaughter of many of the enemy, and with all Lykelyhoode, haue perfourned a farre greater matter, if the former attempt had bene neglected.


And lastly after the Lord Lieutenant generall cominge from Dublin to Kilkenny, and understandinge what villainies were comitted by Owny O Moore, Bryan Reogh and theire vnblessed crewe: vppon his tenantes and followers of the county of Kilkenny and the borders of Tipporarrey levied a force of such soldiers, which were neerest vnto him, and so sent them vnder the conduct of his nephew Capten James Butcher, to coape with the enemy: who vnderstandinge thereof, mynded not to make any flight, allthough he was assisted by many of the piccardyne soldiers but drew resolute to fight havinge some advauntadge of a bog and a woode for a back, which as you know they doe comonely vse, which is greate an advauntadge against our comepanies, that must kepe

**Silvyn**
It appereth that Sir Ed: Harbert hath bene mightly back frended, that being allwaies willing to serve, and the man they moste shot at, could not haue some CCth men in pay (which no doubt if that he had, as it seemeth fit to me (allthough neuer there) he woulde haue perfourmed more then those that promised much, and perfourmed nothinge, for it was a verry easy matter, to haue ouerthrown them, beinge so wearied with travaiele, lack of victualles, and want of sleepe, but as for those sly companyons that with such curtesy enterteigned him and his cursed crew, I never had better hoape of them, since the begynning of your history., but what did the garrysone soldiers of Phillipstowne for I am suer they were not gon, far forthe of the country.

And would haue contynved in the same place a day longer but feare of the garrysonne soldiers, And so by easy Journeies passed thorough honest Odoynes country) and from thence into Leix., where he chaunced to haue some small conference with his companion in harmes, Brian Reogh, being then ready to pack Antechristes goode master.


Nowe comes there vpp with Tirrell, a worthye back slyder named Lishagh McCallogh O Connor, & he beinge longe maynteigned and better brought vp, then his deserts requyed, with Sir G.

**Silvyn**
It is a wonder to see, how commaunders and men of aucthoritie may be ouerulde, by such hippocrittes as Terence O Conner was, for as I remember, he is bothe a kynne to Tirrell, and behouldinge to hym for his lyfe, when Sir Edward Harbert, and capten Gifford, followed him into Leix, at which tyme he was taken prisoner in the retreict, therefore of all men, his worde shoulde

Then when Tirrell was passed into Leix, he was safe enough. for Owny O moore was not a litle glad of his cominge; in respect of my Lord Generalles expedicion: and that his senesholl Brian Reogh was passed to the Sulphure mynt: and so a freash commaundment was sent for Sir Christoner Sct Lawrence, and the garrysonne of Phillipstowne, and none left bhynde, but xxxti of Capten Cowleyes soldiers to kepe the forte, and sixtene of the said knight to assest the townsmen., but they were no sooner gon towardes the Lorde Generall, but the vyperly connors at Moylith peepes owt of theire denne; and takes victualles, in Mr Dempsies countrie and Geshill, at theire pleasures: and then growes to councell how they should burne Phillipstowne: in which matter of weight Terence O Connors councell was not behynd, for that poore burrough was in no small pearle in their eyes, and so vppon the xviiith day of July 1598 ii houers before day a hundreth of those vypers, vnder the heading of Lyshagh O Connor, Murtogh og McTirlagh, Murtogh McOwen, Donogh Poape and Patrick O Darmot, were brought into the waste of the town by the threasone of the watch (beinge Irish) and none to guard the same, but ix men: which stoode in the market place with the burrough master, who seing the shot of the enemy light vppon some of his trusty frendes, and not able to make the place good, and in especially, for that sixtene soldiers aforesaid came not to rescue, according to theire promis, was driven to repaier to the fforte, and to the south gatehouse, from whence a tryed soldier shot at Patrick O Darmot (being then theire martyall, and slew him, wherevppon the enemy reculed, but yet burnt all the town, except some howeses (which parte of them hath bene fyered sythence, but that single mischaunce of Patrick Darmot so grieved them: that for hast they stripp Mr Martiall, and left him in pleadge for the croes., it was a greate pittie to se how the poore people and inhabitantes of the towne, beinge awaked forthe

And so the key of the countries betwene Athloane and Dublin; and from Mullingar to Limberick was then loste to the vtter undoing of many a poore subiect: and the hurt of the garrysone soldiers appointed to that place, besydes the cuttinge of, of all entercourse from the lowest to the highest: and even at the verry same tyme, was parte of Iniscorfye a garrysonne towne in the county of Wexford, formerly entreated of burned by calling away them of the garrysonne; but not a place standinge to so much effect as Phillipstowne did, yet bothe of them sclenderly reguarded, wheresoeuer the fault was., being English keyes for the preservacion of her maiesties countries and subiectes in those severall partes; And yet allthough some two thowsand horse and foote, were gathered togither, to haue persecuted Tirrell and Owny O Moore, & bothe armies encamped one so nere another, that the enemy plaied into the Lorde Generalles campe, with theire shot and hurte one of the pickardynes wyves (yet allthoughe greate suite was made by the captens vnto his honour, that thy might fight with the enemy, it was by his lordship not thought requisite, the cause thereof

Now truly brother I was assured that after Tirrelles departure: beinge afforded him in such favourable manner, I shoulde here of, some notable exployte sone after., for I ensuer you the losse of a garrysone towne, cannot chuse, but be the ouerthrowe of the English and other the good subiectes adiogninge: being the verry high way to bringe that country equall with Leix: so that if it be not buylt againe in tyme: and some favourable respect had of the poore inhabitantes by the high powers, her maiestie shalbe driven shortely, to victuall the same, (to her no small chardges) as she doth now the fforte in Leix: for take away theire market, and the concourse of buyinge and sellinge; there must of necessitie follow greare hurte to the soldiers for want of victualles, fyer and lodginge; and vtter distruction to the poore inhabitantes, not knowinge elswhere to get theire livinges: as for your seignieurs of Dempsies country, I haue said enough of them allready, and withowt there be some hanginge emongst them, and the rest of the borderers, it canne be no otherwyse but naught still, for there hath bene neuer pleadge taken in at any tyme hertofore for the securitie of those partes, but the birding boy; which argueth greate weaknes of care and preservacion of those partes (wheresoeuer the fault is, well for that there was nothinge effected in the greate expedicion, but turninge taiele to taiele, what after ensved.

After those base Cockatriticall base Connors had burned Phillipstowne, and assured of theire ffrendes good successe in Leix., then they setled themselues to be lordes of Aphaley indeed, and fell a preaing of brymieghams country, and other places belonging to the English, and for that they woulde be suer, that the poore Inhabitantes of Phillipstowne should not take the advauntadge of any waste houses standinge on the south syde, thereof, vppon the

And thus havinge devyded themselues as aforesaid parted the goodes and spoyles of the subiect emongst them, and kept theire biellies in the said places. beinge allwayes guarded with some of theire caterpillers whylest the rest reaved abroade for more spoyle. Then beare harvest beinge come those vypers lyinge at moylith, burned balinrath, balleybaley Sir George Cowleyes and Mr ffraunces Harbertes.

Vppon this good success Terence McTeig O Connor knowinge himself to be (Ipse Carnifex) aboue the rest (notwithstanding the favour his father had from her maiestie and her awncestors, for his services in Scotland, and otherwyse, his owne lyvinge, his enterteignment, and his wyfe and many children, relyinge vppon him., put in for the best gaine, and would needes thrust owt his cosen Lishagh McCallogh, and take the halter vppon himself, And so refusinge the premisses for the bare name, of a forlorne title of O Connor had *?land?*, was about the xvi of August 1598 crowned with a cooniagh of bone clabbagh Rex Basiliscus of all those fyery serpentes, And to shew himself in his cullers, thinckinge that his verry bare name woulde make the trees to tremble, the bogs to quake, the poore churles and callioghes to kneele and all beastes of the field, to be to him obedient, drawes the night ffollowinge to the Durrough (a place neuer owt of rememberaunce) and

**Silvyn**
It is an easy matter to vanquish those vypers, if order had bene first taken with the borderers for sufficient pledges: for ffrom them, proceedthe all their, help and a perillous thing it is, for her maiesties people to fight with them in theire owne fastnesses: they knowing full well how to devyde themselues to annoy our people: and to retourne to theire places of rest when they shall thinck it good, and her maiesties army driven to kepe the high way lest being d they be ouertaken, & so not permitted to gather themselues into one boddy againe., besydes this, for that theire hath bene no meanes taken to provoake the borderers to serve vppon them, or to call in such of theire kinred and affinity, as they haue emongst the enemy: which be the verry instrumentes: that they svstaigne no harme, either in theire boddies houses or cattell. (except victuall) they happely vnder cullour of subiectes help them with powder, municion and other wantes, for they cannot be so conynvally supplied therwith, withowt the helpe of such people as they are, for whom it is lawfull to haue entercourse into townes and citties, where the premisses is sould, as for Terence O Connor I had neuer better hoape of him.

**Peregryn**
Well, allthough some kynde of favour is shewed for the tyme: it is but to cullour a greate pece of mischief, intended: as the sequele will declare.


**Silvyn**
Nowe truly I am of that opynion; but what is become of Tirrell.


**Peregryn**
After he had so well escaped from the Lord Lieutenant generall as aforesaid, he and his vnblessed crew made ouer into the kinges county, and there visites his friends in all places, takinge theire pledges and oathes to be true to Lucyfer, but Sir Charles O Carroll somewhat disquieted himself and rablement, in sleaing some of his worthiest spirites: for I tell you, that same knight hath shewed himself, right well to her maiestie in this broken tyme, and his brother in law McCoghlan for ought that I coulde learne, medleth verry litle or nothinge at all with the enemy, for his countruy is bothe fast and stronge, and his people hardy, There is a demi lord in that country called the ffox; who in all these broyles (allthough verry valyant, never yielded to be a consorte with the wicked: and yet so pinched with penury, and crossed by a mighty seignieur, that it would haue provoaked most men of his coate to haue revolted., In all Tirrell lyinge here for this tyme, litle or nothinge was effected, except the killinge of Conly Duff McGoghegan and so after this Tirrell, hearing of the Lord Lieutenant generalles goinge into Leix to victuall the New forte repaiers towardes Owny O Moore.


**Silvyn**
Well, I perceaue Tirrell canne teach our Greate Segnieurs what they should doe, for he will breake no parte of his masters commision and a happy thinge it is that we haue lighted vppon some honest Ireland lordes in those partes,

but what is McCoghlan, as for the ffox I perceaue he is no greate lord when he may be so easely ouermatched, and as for Conly Duff somewhat he is to be mourned, consideringe his former service.


**Peregryn**
Macoghlan hathe a fyne faste country as I said before and bordereth vppon Sir Charles and for that he lay still, and never gaine nor toke in these last warrs, I may not bluse him forth; emongst the rest of the wicked borderers, yet as I remember, An arch ruynour romish prelate (as it is reported) should bringe him a dispensacion from Lucyfer, at his beinge in the Northe.


**Silvyn**
There muste needes be somewhat in it: that he lay still as a newter, and neither gave nor tooke, but gaped to see which way the world would wag, but proceed.


**Peregryn**
After Tirrelles departure, carynge

Donell McArte Omoloy with him into Leix: Sir Chrisoners and Capten

wheate harvest in Aphaley, yet the locustes left behynde, did no

perfourmed in Leix, at which expedicion the best of the Connors

were.


Aboute the begynninge of September the Lord Lieutenant generall vnderstandinge that victualles grew scarce, with those of the new forte, raysed some xviC horse and foote: and went himself in personne with them: whose purpose being well knowne to the enemy: Owny O Moore, Tirrell, Mcgennis his sonne, the O Connors & other theire accomplices shrowded themselues betwene the blackforde and Stradbally, theire accustomed place, of assembly to annoy the convoy, and so our

**Silvyn**
What a chardge is it to her maiestie, the losse of that country of Leix: being now contynvally dreven, to victuall the forte with an Army: And allthough the expedicion was well perfourmed by the Lord Lieutenant and his comepany, to the foyle of the Enemy, yet Consideringe the great chardges and losse of her highnes people it is but deerly bought: Also it seemeth to me that Owny O Moore and Tirrell, are Ioygned in one comyssion from theire Master Lucyfer, for the Actes of Leix are and haue bene, awnswered with greater resolucion by the Enemy, then in any other place where they haue come, but it ap-eth there as honest borderers vppon that coaste, as vpon Aphaley for there is the haven of rest.


**Peregryn**
You may be suer of that, for three of the Aphalian fronters, as the doynes, the dempsyes and barnaby connor (but especially the two first haue most of theire lyvinges in the Queenes County called Leix; There is also a noble gentillman, called the

**Silvyn**
Why[brvbar] I pray you how hould they theire landes, that they are not affraid, to harbour and countenaunce the enemy as aforesaid.


**Peregryn**
They houlde by knight service, as the rest of the English doe; especially Mr Dempsy.

if those borderers had theire right, the army shoulde haue bene bent against them and live vppon theire goodes., And better it were it should be so, then they thus to remayne as staplers for men, victualles and mvnicion for thge vphouldinge of the Enemy, and if had bene effected in tyme they would haue sunge another tvne; but I smell they are verry liberall to theire advocates in courte; who pleaded theire case irronically (honest for dishonest): There is one that is to come ouer martiall, whose harde fortvne was not to contynew there longe after his arryvall; to the hurte of that naked estate, that if he had lived, yea but a small tyme, would haue taught them: to singe theire Anthem beofre evensonge.


**Peregryn**
In faith brother well remembered for there are a comepany of martlemas men, dwelling not farre from trym, whereas if that Sir Richard Bingham had lived he should haue beene seated there, and these kynde of people, are the best victuallers of the connors when Aphaley affordes them naught.


**Silvyn**
What meane you by martlemas men, it shoulde seeme they lovue well hangd meat: for as I take it: they are stoared with beof and bacon, which will requier good stoare of Lycour.


**Peregryn**
These martlemas men, dwell aboute the river of the Boyne and are fat fellowes in deed and for that the redmoore, the blacksharde, with other places of fastnes, be meete for the cursed Connors, they are receaued by the aforesaid Seigniours withe greate favour (when freash victualles in other places, waxeth scarce.) and emongst them harboured, aswell for ould allyance and acquayntance as for that the Connors make some of them theire threasurers, of such spoyle as is gotten in other places, so theise fellowes will neuer be good except they be hanged vpp in the sonne in stedd

of the smoake, as one toulde me that aboute some xxi/xxiitie? yeares agoe, Sir William Colliar deceassed, had martiall lawe in those partes and he so scoured my martlemas men, that the countrie was the better many yeares after, And one thinge more I can assure you of, that placing the martiall at Trymme It will be a greate help for the Quiet of the English pale and the borders about it for in former tymes it was martialles place of residence vntill Sir Nicholas Bagnall had the office and got footinge in the Newry, and other landes thereaboutes; and besydes all this it lyeth in the bowelles of the realme.


**Silvyn**
Well brother I am sorry of Good Sir Richard Binghams death, for his going ouer as I did here with wonderfull credit woulde haue daunted all his enemies on that syde of the sea; for now it appeared to the worlde: how he was wronged, and what want Ireland had of him (I meane the good subiect) but what haue we done with Tirrell.

After the victuallinge of the new forte (the cursed connors) drawes into Aphaley againe (but Mr Terence Connor had paid his way) so that the foresaid Lishagh McCallogh taketh in hand to rule the roaste and in the absence of the garrysonne, that then was not come home, he with his vypers taketh away: from Phillipstowne some xxxtie cowes: whom such soldiers as were left at home skirmisht with and no greate harme but that one Andrew Linch a corporall in Capten Cowlies band was slaigne., And much aboute this tyme Capten Richard Gifforde entred the enemies aboute Clonbaley and had some bickering with the Connors, where he slew that vyper Shane Ballogh with some ii or three other, himself

I ensuer you, I am right glad of Capten Giffordes good succes, but what is become of the archtraytor Tirrell. for now I thinck he be cleane poasted away.

No doubt, there wanted, a provident care bothe in the begynninge, and contynvance of those broyles, how to haue suppressed those malladies for now the disease, withowt gods help (as many tymes is saide before is allmoste growen incvarable and no doubte, the meane how to redresse those matters in tyme., was well knowne to many if opportunitie had bene taken. but I haue many tymes before this, thought to haue asked you, whither the Lorde Generall at his beinge at Phillipstowne; never smelt owt such, as fostered vpp the base Connors, he havinge receaued the complaynantes of the country inhabitantes.

The Lord Lieutenant Generall as I haue bene for truth ascertayned, handled some of my greate masters of Aphaley in theire kynde, for he assembled as many of them togither as were then in the country, and sware them vpoon the evangelist, that they shoulde truly deliuer vnto him, vnder their handes, by whom and with whome, those wicked Connors had bene fostered and bredde vpp: which was effected a Phillipstowne, and iustified agayne, before the lord Justices and councell at Dublin, but some emongst the rest allthough that course was daungerous vnto them, yet lyke honest Christians, rather ventured to play the barristers, then to be fownd periurates.


**Silvyn**
This was a verry wyse course to bringe owt the truth, but I thinck those that be guilty of that cryme, woulde haue bene contented to haue paied, tenne fifteenes, & as many subsidies, as houres in the day, that, that recorde were metamorphosed, to a blanck charter for feare of venias mecum, but I warrant you Sir Edwarde Harbert was none of the forlorne seigniors.


**Peregryn**
No nor doiers otherrs neither, for you haue harde that Sir Edwarde Harbert was allwaies shor at by them and others, but if he might haue had, both men and countenaunce to haue prosecuted the kinges county affaiers he would quickly haue cleered that roaste.


**Silvyn**
It is greate pittie but that the vertuous and true meaninge man shoulde be employed in such a daungerous tyme, but I may never forget, what a passion some of your greate seigniers suffer, that had subscribed, there was some helpinge frendes that farthered this devyse.

I will never ask you no more interpretacions for I smell him as farre as the ould baley but now I trust we huae allmoste deone with Aphaley for the yeere is neere hande ended.


**Peregryn**
Now truly brother, I haue not far to proceede but I will growe to an ende with those partes, but as yet Mr Tirrell kepeth his estate there as yet: And in the meane tyme vppon the xv of September 1598 vpp cometh Orowrk that periurate basilisk into Westmeath, and enters Sir John Tirrelles country, with a hundreth horsmen, and as many shot mounted behynde them: which he let slip vppon the svddaigne, and he preas all that quarter where Tirrelles ffrendes dwelt, and kild sundry gentillmen of his kindred, with some burninge done besydes and so departed, and for that the other parte of the country beinge enemies to Richard Tirrelles proceedinges, should not laugh his ffrendes to scorne on the next daye followinge, he preaed and spoyled them, and so betwene ii imperious miscreantes that country was spoyled.

I thinck so indeede, but pittie it is, that the well meaninge man, and true subiect, should be thus vsed withowt revendge, but it cannot be otherwyse as longe as theire neighbours will not assist them.


**Peregryn**
Ogh Sir a many of them, will not stick to say, why shoulde we serve, and have no enterteignment of her maiestie, as though they were not bownde by theire tenures to doe the same; but as Teige oge o doynes awnswere was, when he was willed by some greate man to certifie of the enemies proceedinges, and to barre them from intercourse into the country, by reasone of his advauntage of the straight at Clare: and to doe as much, as in him did lye: he certified by his letter, that all his men were gon to the rebelles, and no boddy to kepe his castell but a boy & himself: and so canne his next neighbour haue threscore men in warde: and yet suffer to passe to and fro quietly. withowt any impeachment.

I pray the speake no more of them, for then hast plagued them to much allreadye and hardly they two are to be matched.

Now aboute Allhallautyde 1598; when the viperous O Connors thought; that all thinges were theire owne in Aphaley, if they coulde accomplish Croghan, and Baley Brittaigne, havinge enterteigned Teig McCales sonnes into theire fraternity, being bretheren to Terence O Connor formerly spoken of & so they with the honest Omoloyes: Ioygne themselves togither and enterteignes one William O Meoney, an onely follower, and servaunt of Sir Thomas Moores, whose credit with his master and wealth by him gotten was such; that any honestman, might haue lived contented with the tythe thereof., yet when the devill hath entred a breach into such kynde of people, he neuer leaueth them; till they performe somewhat to their owne distruction, so this vngracious disciple, with other his consortes to the nomeber of tenne *more/nowe?* in the housse: drawes in those reprobates ouer the ditches and watters aboute some three howers before day at a place by west the house nere adiogninge to a chamber, where gentle Gifford with his wyfe, then lay: who heeringe such a mighty noyse: And the enemy ready to enter the chamber where they were: came downe from thence into the hall which is wyde and spacious, where fyndinge his weaponnes, stood to his defence: buit being ouerlaid was their throwne downe, with many a wounde, his wyfe to saue him was also moste grevously hurte in many places of her body: Sir Thomas Moore then lyinge in the Castell, heeringe such a noyse in the hall, came forth and fought but being ouermatched, thinckinge to haue recouered himseld from them, withowt harme at the enteringe of the castell doare; was thrust in it a sworde into the boddy: the ould lady his wyfe being abroade was taken prisoner: then the enemy, hauvinge entred within the first dore, thought to haue wonne the castell, but Capten Giffords

All which a brother of Shane Ballaghes, that Capten Gifforde killed at Clonbouley, vnderstandinge went vnto him forthwith as he lay on the grownde and with his skeyne, cut his throate, the lady at her goinge away with the enemy and in respect of her age was carried betwene two of the reprobates, those of the castell thinckinge not of her, shot at the troope and hurte her in the shoulder, but er euer it were long, she was deliuered back by the meanes of her daughter, marryed to callogh O moloy., during this bickerment at Croghan: one Edmond Coulgan, a farmer vnder the said Sir Thomas: thincking that the castell had bene taken: poastes to Baleybrittaigne: to a brother of his named Patrick Coulgan: who was marryed to Ashleys daughter, an Englishman sometyme

I neuer thought otherwyse, but theise villaignes would requyte their ffosterers in this kynde of sorte in the ende, but now sithence you haue made ane ende with the country: I pray you shew me what kynde of thinges is the castell and forte of Phillipstowne: for I doe assure myself, they be places of greate pryce, and famous in those partes

for the preservacion of the countries adiogning.


**Peregryn**
The fforte is but a slight thinge, sometyme envyroned aboute with a stoane wall of small strength., havinge a gatehouse; and three Other flanckers in the middest of euery quarter, and a house for the lieutenant (when any was there.) to ly in called the frame, And in the middest, standeth the castell, which was raysed vppon an oulde fowndacion: when the country was first conquered, but bothe castell and forte growe alltogether rvynous, and allmoste not worthy to be spoken of.


**Silvyn**
Why that is a greate pittie, that such thinge should not be maynteigned, and I am suer though that some parte of the wall be fallen, yet the fowndacion was stronge enough, to haue borne the stoanes againe.


**Peregryn**
Yea brother; but there was a farther meaninge in it, for I take the forte to be no lesse then sixtene score yardes aboute: and when the wynde was at the easte (especially in winter tyme, the estates that then lay there, could not well abyde, neather the vigor thereof., nor be ffree from the contynvall concourse of suiters & others, that presvmed to enter before they were called. (and for the speedy preventinge of those inconvenyences, and to be at more ease for want of other matter, they quartered forth a courte yarde, with the decayed wall of the forte; leavinge the breach lyke elbow lane and so it contynved vntill these warrs, which was rampiered vpp with earthe by the forsight of Lieutenant Rushen. And as for the deepe ditches, about the walles, they haue bene so providently lookt vnto, from tyme

**Silvyn**
Why then I perceaue, there hathe bene careles husbandry (ab origine: but I pray you tell me; is the castell gor to wrack in the lyke sorte, or who wayted shee vppon for her repaired suites.


**Peregryn**
The castell, when she was first espoused was an inheritance, of some fower plough land a half, with some comodities therto belonginge, duringe which tyme she was maignteigned verry well in apparrell: with her costly felt of leade: but after shee had buryed her first husbande, she was marryed to a seconde, who vppon some especiall ocasion him mightely moovinge toke away her landes and put her to her pencion; which is growne to be so small and her *?land? [something metaphorical]* so longe to come before it will retourne into her handes againe: that shee was driven for pure neede to sell away her leaden felt, that couered the platfourmed hed from all weathers, and learne to imitate the churles of fengall: being glad to weare a strawe hat of half a crowne in steed of her good felt, so that now beinge driven to this shift, shee hath often sued for a divorce, but yet canne get none: by reasonne that she

Nowe. owt alas, whom is that good Quene delt with, (yet it is no mervaiele, as the oulde proverbe is, every man for himself and god for vs all. And so it doth well appeere by the former relacion, now I perceaue: you haue done with the kinges county, I pray you let me here somewhat of Connaght.


Thus endeth the seconde booke.

ffor matters happeninge in Connaght, I canne say litle: more then it was fortvne to be in place, where I harde a discourse betwene an oulde soldiour, of those partes in tymes paste, and a travayler accustomed to buy cattell, in the said province.

I pray you let me here it, for I haue allwaies desyred to here of such thinges, that haue happened there, and the rather that Sir Richard Bingham served there sometymes, whose government as I haue harde reported, was to easy for such a stiff necked people: but no doubt he hath bene wished by the English there rezidinge many tymes sithence his departure, And now to the matter.

**Soldier**
Mr Jacob, you are moste hartely wellcom from Conaght, I pray you what is the best newes there.


**Jacob**
Noe truly fellow soldier, I haue litle or nothing worthe the tellinge, for I loue not to entermeddle, with any mans matters but with myne owne privie affaiers.


**Soldier**
Yet I pray you let me but ask you how my oulde ffrendes doe, as Mr John Croftonne, Mr George Goodeman, Mr Martyne Lisley, Mr John Newtonne, Mr Richard Graftonne, Mr Birchell and honest Phinehes Clay, the provoaste martialles deputy, Mr Henry Ormesby, and diuers others of mynde acquayntance, for you knowe it is longe sithence I was in those partes.


**Jacob**
I knowe it right well, and as for those gentillmen with a nomeber of others, whose names are to tedious here to set downe, haue prayed for oulde Sir Richarde Binghame (though now Antragh, as the Irish proverbe is (to late.


**Soldier**
It is a greate matter, for many of them, which here shalbe nameles (coulde not kepe him whilst they had him, but must needes bee in theire innovacions: so that some of them, coulde never a true Anthem of Legum pone sithence:, It is tould me by a frend that the province of Conaght is verry quyet in these daies.


**Jacob**
It muste needes be quyet, for a man may travaiele longe enough there, before he see any boddy, to fall owt with him for a night ceasse.

Then it apperes that the country is waste, how doe they then pay the soldiers.

**Soldier**
I ensuer you I am glad, I cam away when I did; and how went the Journey forwarde at Baleyshannon.


**Jacob**
I was not there, and loathe I am to declare any particularities towchinge the Journey: but suer I am that governor now there, had a greate army, aswell of soldiers as of the rysinges owt. But whither for want of provision of victuall or mvnicon, or by what chaunce I knowe not; after he had thought to haue recouered the same. He was forced to repaier away with speed, the enemy comminge so freashely vppon him: with the losse of the Lorde of Inchequyn that was drowned by venturinge ouer somewhat to rashley, and his lieutenant Mr Osborne and Sir Henry Norrices lieutenant named Maunde, with diuers others slaigne; and glad so to escape.


**Soldier**
Well Jacob, I seur the day: the enemy coulde not easely haue prevayled against our people, but since these farlandish deuyses, trickes, conceipts and termes (as fylinges, haltes, randevooes. and a nomeber the lyke (came in vse here, the enemy neuer so muche florished, well I pray you tell me, how that rascell Haggerd shiftes, emongst them that towers so high.

Let him alone for he soares aloft still, for whosoeuer is huntsman in those partes, he will not be the hindmost hownde., but for all his sweete mouthe It is naturally given him to hunt counter still.

**Jacob**
He hath a chardge; and hath done feates of armes in the county of Maio, and hath put wardes in castle barre, Clonnegashill Mc Jourdaynes chief house, and diuers other places, and is well countenaunced by the governour, with promis that he will assist him in the procuring of the gift, of any such places as he shall recouer from the enemy:

What favour in shorte time: will make him aspyere to be a mac william, and thence once at the highest: he will foregt from whence he cam, but I had allmost let slipp a braue harmefull creature Hugh McTirlagh roe.

He is a greate man, and bothe he and hugh O Connor dvnne hath kearne and shot in pay.


**Soldier**
No doubt but they will doe greate service emongst the bullies.


**Jacob**
Yes but they will, for the gouernour hath taken in all the best pledges (in the province, and sent them to gallway: for beinge the better assured of the countries alledgeance.


**Soldier**
In that poynt the Governour doeth, as beseemeth, , but for the erecting of such kynde of people as they are (especially that Crocodill Hugh McTirlagh roa: a noted traytor against good government, I mervaiele not a litle.

Why what other name, doe they attribute to themselues.


**Jacob**
Marry Seignieur Soldato, they call themselues Territory comaunders, havinge theire Lieutenant Traynors vnder them, to bringe vp theire followers to learne the feates of Armes, to ouertoppe such as you are.


**Soldier**
Now truly I thinck so indeede; for theire hathe bene so many such scollers, trayned vp in that province, that moste of the bandes (except the new supplies forth of England (are Conaght men. And of the right stampe for treacherye for some of them were at the murtheringe of Capten George Bingham, and Capten ffieldew, at the Rasing of Sligo, and betrauyinge of Arran, but moste of them actors in rebellion as I haue hard, but I pray you canne you tell me, what the chiefest cause was that so many of those provinciall libertynes, should drawe into all partes of the realme. and the governour havinge cause to vse them there.


**Jacob**
As I haue bene informed, the first cause was that in respect the provynce was wasted, by the entercourse, aswell of the northerne enemy: as by those libertynes of the province themselues, victualles and other necessaries (where comon hostillitie is grew scarce.) so that theire first abetters and setters on, cast them of and submitted themselues, to her maiesties mercy, (by which meanes havinge no goodes of theire owne, neither any employment from her maiesty in those partes, made suite to the governour that they might passe into Leinster, and to serve there against her maiesties enemies; who wysly wayinge the offer to be good., to ridd his governement of such a reabble, poasted them over the bridge of Athloane into Leymster, where now they swarme not onely in bandes, but in

**Soldier**
Well Seignieur Jacob you shall here that these kynde of subtle companions now entred Leimpster and other places to serve in her maiesties pay: doe but even counterfeict the grasier of England: who devydeth his pasture into cloases, the sooner to make his cattell fit for the shambles, forseing theire owne country of Connaght, overrunn, and nothing therein left, to suffice theire myndes and belllies, shiftes themselues into other countries, takinge the sweetnes thereof, vntill theire owne be growne rype againe; and some of the right stampe haue busynes for them, and then a suddayne retreict is sounded, home, home., for her maiesties pay is nothing then with them, vnles they may haue the spoyle of towne and country where they come. And no pvnishment for any owtradge they comit because they are so stronge whereas they serve, but in deede one Thomas Bourke with the yellow lockes, that was at Sligo when Capten George Bingham was slaigne, was taken tardy, for strykinge of Ensigne Ashley and hanged by Sir Warham Sctledger.


**Jacob**
I protest vnto thee soldier, thou saieth true, and a verry good pece of service, in doing the same.,

Truely Seignieur Jacob, it is a perillous world, for you remember how the bases condicioned rouges of Connaght (when Sir John Norris was there) thundered owt

matter against that renowned Sir Richard Bingham; whose lyfe, actes, paynes and governement was such, in that estate, that neither for ordynary warrs, or any other affaiers or extraordinary warrs beinge a growinge chardge in that province, was litle or nothing at all, chardgeable or payable, owt of her maiesties transported threasure. for Ireland, And also when that might commaunder Sir John Norros then lieutenant generall of her maiesties fforceis, had the most puissant army at Balinroabe, against Odonell and his associates that hath bene lightly harde of since the conquest, yet trustinge rather to a peace (which happely he with the some others he had certified into England) loste one of the best opportvnities that euer was harde of in that lande., as the Enemy coulde verry well reporte afterwardes themselues.


**Jacob**
I remember there was a solider of Sir George Bowrchiers: that figure owt, that if Sir Richard Bingham had bene there; it shoulde either bene his, or Odonelles.


**Soldier**
In deede there was such a matter, but the fellow had bene hanged if he had bene knowne for speakinge the truthe., but as these caterpillers of Connaght said, that Sir Richard Bingham was neuer well, but when he was in Armes, yet I canne tell you this muche: that he that thincketh to make an established Comon wealth in Connaght with the worde; and put away the sworrde, may make vpp his accompte with him, that coulde bringe tenne to nothinge, ffor I tell you the worlde had experience, in that oulde Seignieur, that bothe in martiall, and pollitique causes, he might not easely be ouerreached, And as for the mannadginge of the affaiers of that province: duringe the tyme the generall (which was longe) and the yearely

**Jacob**
Well my good soldier, I canne say thus much in mynde owne knowledge, that as longe as the Connacians were kept vnder, and not suffered to swarne in troopes but forced to followe the plough and grasinge of cattell, all thinges florished, and her maiestie was well paied her rent, but once they got the reyne and permitted to take Armour and weapin vppon them (a greate parte whereof Sir Richarde had depryued them of before, then woulde they enduer no cvrbe, and what will become of those erected bandes of the Irish within a whyle I know not: except to rebellion againe: for thye looke suer upon theire dischardge, to haue either landes or pencions.


**Soldier**
By the pittie of a pilcharde that is true: And I ensuer you, I know not to waht vse they will serve, except they may be shipt for Nova hispania, China or any other of those goulden places that be farre of, for you knowe her maiestie hath no gallies to exercyese theire Armes (and if she had, they woulde doe ther greate service, for theire lymbs are bothe lardge and stronge:, And if they be let a grasinge agayne, they will quickly make fyer enough, though the subiect pay for the roaste., but I had allmoste forgot my self to ask you of the estate of Athloane.

That was well donne, of the Governour but I pray you what is become of Balleymoate.


**Jacob**
Marry Sir[brvbar] even gon ffrom vs, to her oulde masters, the Clondonaghes agayne, for Sir Conyers as he thought, has placed there as counstable a verry sufficient gentillman of his owne retynew, who coulde neuer take rest in his bedde, for the greate lamentacion that the desolate Sligo made beinge abandoned of all her good English frendes, and neuer a sister of hers of any reputacion (except Coolooney) woulde either comfort her, or mourne with her for comepany.


**Soldier**
Why I am suer the constable, coulde neither here or be troubled with such fantasies, being twelve longe myles off., and as I take it, this is but some of your ould Kilkenny visions.


**Jacob**
Well, for all your sportinge quibbes, he was not withowt thre vesselles of Kilkenny potions when he toke so greate pitty of the lamentacion aforesiad, that either by negligence or fatall destenye, some of my cosen Clondonaghs, beinge there mixed emongst the warde: betrayed mr counstable, withdrawinge forthe of his trustieth people, leavinge few within; but himself and the porter, who was killed by one of that graceles crew, and so bothe house, counstable and all Englishmen taken (with mighty spoyl besydes.

And then farewell Conaght.


**Jacob**
I protest vnto thee, thou saieth true: for I lyke not the loosinge of such places, for now the county of Sligo is wholy gon, but I must needs say the governor had ill fortvne, to loase it for as I remember he was lieutenant of Sir Richarde foteband when Balleymoate was first wonne


**Soldier**
It is very true, but it is longe sithence, for his small aboade in Connaght at the first: And his greate discontynvauncies sithence; brought him some what owt of square, to maundge and governe; suche a treacherous people In whom except the Erles of Thoemonde, Clanricarkard and the Lorde Birmindgham: with some of theire dependantes there is small helpe of theire alledgeances, for as I vnderstand by others, the governour giues them landes, feeds them with mony, and fayer wordes, which if he withdrew neuer so litle from them, away they are gon, if they had giuen in: never so many pleadges, or taken a thowsand oathes to be true., but if he mynde to reforme them, he must follow the course of his Anctient commaunder and predecessor, (who as oulde as he was) kept no saunctuary in Athloane, nor in Roscommon, when he was there, but in campe day and night, takinge tenne tymes more paynes, then moste men

**Jacob**
Well fellow souldier, it had bene better for her maiestie, and the good subiect of Irelande, by more mony then I will speake of, that good Sir Richard had not bene so remoued nor so vexed and overtopped as he was:, And his councell followed., well knowinge and forseinge of the eventes of thinges to come, but he was to good for this country, And so it apereth, for we are allmoste, as nere to seeke Ireland, as at the first conquest, God amend all that is amis.


**Soldier**
You haue said the truth, but I pray you how escapes George Lane at Tulsk.


**Jacob**
Marry not longe sithence that Archtraytor Hugh McTirlagh Roa O Connor, had gotten the vpper parte of the Castell, and George havinge left some bourdes loose of the hall loft to come into the seller, discended downe thither with some of his people vnknown to the traytor and his comepany. They drew vpp the bourdes, and thought to come into the seller, but he slew six of them at one clapp, wherevppon the fearfull rascall with his comepany pact then away: and so the castell and house recouered againe.


**Soldier**
That was well done in deede, but in what credit is Brian O Rourke with the governor.

He, I marry, was hee: with Sir Conyers, but he serued him as good a trick as any

I haue receaued your kynde epistle; wherein I vnderstand all the estate of Aphaley: with the succes of our ffrendes there., which grieveth me not a litle, And allthough the newes be not greately to any lykinge: ywt for that I woulde be loath to dye in your debt: not knowinge when I shall repaier homewardes, beinge also by your self therevnto required, straigned my groase capacitie, to acquaynte you with some of these northerne affaiers: And allthough I cannot make a particular declaracion of every accident theire happeninge, yet will I briefly roave at them, as neere as I may, not doubtinge but they shalbe well accepted at your masterships handes, how rude soeuer they be set downe, and so ad rem.


First as it shoulde seme, when relacion had bene in England, what small succes the cessacions had: betwene Sir John Norris then Lieutenant Generall, And the traitor Tyroane: in which tyme of peace, most treacheries were effected; and tyme worne owt to no other purpose, but to thadvantadge of the enemy: and the greate chardge of her maiestie: with the Impouerishinge of all the English Pale., and the borders adioigning, by the often recourse; to and fro of the Army, besydes the intollerable somes of mony, and victualles extorted (by the brittaigne troopes, duringe the tyme they were ceassed in the pale or in any other place whersoeuer, for all was fish that came to net, As for theire infantry footemen, (as they

So that it was but neede, to provyde a present salue; to cure so greate a soare; least in shorte tyme it might haue growne remediles. And vppon that[brvbar] the noble lorde Thomas Burgh, was sent ouer deputie, to suppie the place of that right worthie and honorable knight, Sir William Russell, whose valure and governement was such: if his governement had bene sole: Ireland had not tasted so much of scarcety as it did, and dothe; by suche extorte measure, nor the raginge of so many thowsand reprobates now spronge vpp: to annoy both prince and subiect., for thou knowest, that I am not alltogither Ignorant in the readinge of histories: which declare the sole governement to be the beste (for the knowledge whereof[brvbar] I will referre thee to Quintus Curtious to Plutarck and others, who treateth of the Romaynes and Grecians & of the macedonians, yea and to our English chronicles to: for as the worlde went, that noble knight, had the title and honour of Lord Deputy: but the Lieutenant generalles warrantes went currant for all thinges: so that in that poynte (his title as aforesaid excepted (no better then a threasurer and a victualler: to se him supplied with all necessaries: but now it may be, some will say: that he had his aucthority: and so had they bothe., and with greate reasonne it was done, that he might ease the Lord Deputy, as was by the higher powers thought meete, but he, that had bene so mighty a comaunder, as Sir John had bene woulde be all in all, in his martiall affaires, or els nothing; so even as betwene two Ceasars Rome went to wrack: so will Ireland to, if it be not looked to in tyme, but admit the Lieutenant Generall haue his aucthoritie, from the Lord deputie: then muyst he serve at his commaund, and not stand vppon poyntes which order went well in Ireland, when that course was houlden: and yet I must not hastly poaste away with that right

worthy Sir William Russell, who in all his affaiers that he toke in hande, aboute martiall causses, had good succes, and for his last farewell, toke of that moste pestilent monster, feugh mchugh, the verry chiefe councelor, harborer & fosterfather of all traytors., And if I were to enter into Sir William Russelles services beinge withowt the compas of my Ulsterian occurrances: I could shew you what worthy matters hee atchieued of himself as in Omaddens country, the burnes and other places.


After this noble gentillman had surrendered the sworde, and the right honorable the Lorde Burgh established in the governement, he lingered not the tyme, but as conveniently as he might, drewe downe his fforceis towardes the fforte at Blackwater: beinge then in the possession of the Traytor Tyroane, and encampinge at Armagh, toke forthe of his Army some thowsande of his moste approued soldiers, and left the rest, in that place till farther direction from him., and so in the night tyme marched towardes the fforte with such expedicion that before Tyroanes warde was once aware, he was vppon theire walles, and ready to enter, At which svddaine and vnlooked for greetinge, after the dischardginge of some few shot away the warde ffledd and left the forte to his lordship, killing but one only soldior.


When that his honor had wonne the same he razed it with the grownde and buylded one not farre from the same, of a larger scoape, In the meane tyme he was assayinge, how he might passe to Dvngannon: and so ffrom thence to Loghfoyle, where he had appointed many barkes with victuall and other necessaries to meet him., but in respect of the greate pace, which he with his Army must passe: and the Erle Traitor with his forceis, withstandinge him to the vttermoste, knowinge that if his honour did passe there, he were in great possibilitie to loese all, made that place good, and fronted his honour in moste warlyke manner, well

After this mishapp, his honour seinge no possible meanes to Accomplish his desier, except he had bene able to haue had another convenient Army, to haue landed at Loghfoyle and so to haue set vppon the Erle Traytor on all sydes, victualled the fforte placinge therein as Counstable, a valyant gentillman named Capten Williams, with some CCth soldiers, And after brake vp campe, and retourned to the Newry, where making but small aboade, drew towardes the Cavan in Awreyleis country, and there placed Sir Christopher Sct Lawrence, comaunder of certaine comepanies there laied in garrysone, And then repaiered to Dublin., And there not contynvinge longe, for that hee considered the proporcion of victuall left with Capten Williams at the forte, was neere hand consvmed, drew thitherwardes agayne with as much expedicion as might be, And even the same day he cam to Armagh, Tyroanes fforceis had beleaguered the forte, and in the ende; the most valyantest men in his retynewe vndertook to wynne the same, for that they had perfect intelligence, that the warde was not onely sick and vnserviceable for the moste parte but all theire victualles consvmed, And so advauncing

After my Lord Deputy was come to the Newry, he fell sick of what disease I knowe not, but even harde vppon michaellmas, lyinge but a small tyme afterward he dyed: to the greate grief of all her maiesties good subiectes, But it is even a scourge comonely incident to this land, that when a noble man, or worthy gentillman cometh ouer hither to doe the country good: Then either he is called away: when he intendeth moste the benefit of this naked Comon wealthe: beinge happely accused for dealinge with to much rigor, (which these libertynes cannot abyde) or els it pleaseth the allmighty to call him to his mercy, to our greater scourge that meane well to her maiesties? soveraigne: but if he be evill, and give the country the raynes, he doth bothe tarry longe, and not departe empty fisted, or els many reportes ar fals)., What a coyle was there in this Realme before the arryvall, of that most renowned the Lorde Arthur Grey, who came ouer in tyme, for if it ploughed but a small tyme longer, it was lyke to haue bene a black day with the English, but allthough his fortvne was somewhat hard at this first entry at the Glynnes, yet or euer he departed he measured, both the length and breadth of the myndes and doinges of the wicked (aswell appered by the gentillmen of the English Pales conspiracy, who well payd for their treachery yet must he needes poaste away before his full tyme.

The seconde gossipride is by breakinge of breade betwene partie and partie: and in this is concluded some smack of mischief intended, which; when any such matter falleth owt, we must doe our best endeavour to remedy the same: for entermedlinge with which sometymes wee are taken vp for halting, yet we neuer come in daunger as wee thinck, till venias mecum *?onceth?*: and still for our paynes some salary cometh for playinge the bolsterers.


The thirde gossipride is, by seuerall oathes voluntarie taken, betwene partie and partie, for the fullfillinge of any covenant betwene them., though it smell as farre as felony, and then sometymes we bringe our selues in daunger to play the barristers.


The fourth and last poynte of Gossipride cannot be thoroughly effected, but by abusinge the holy sacrament of the comvnion: which all parties in that league combyned (most receaue the same to confirme any thinge, that is or shalbe from thence forth, agreed vppon, betwene them, yea though it smell of rebellion, murder, threasonne, burninges etc or any other capitall degree of what nature soeuer, so that by the illusion,

Then last of all. when we haue thoroughly performed, these ceremonies aforesaid, yet that cannot be thought sufficient unles we marry one with another, And there cometh in kinred, Allyance and affynitie of bludd, and then when this mixture hath taken thorough roote, we ffeare not any daunger whatsoeuer, but whylest we thinck our selues in greatest securitie, owt startes our fosterers, gossips and Allies, of the Irish pale into rebellion, and then some of vs, that haue traced these galliardes aforesaid, must adventure our selues in respect of the premisses, to be assistant vnto them, aswell private and publique, though we venture both lyfe, goodes, landes, and perpetuall Infamy besydes, yet you must vnderstand, I speake not this onely of the English Pale, but of all other partes of the Realme where Englishmen haue bene planted, Well accordinge to our tenvres, we are called to serve against the Enemy: and then not as we were wont to doe in proceedinge tymes (as formerly I repeated beinge compared to a sheafe of Arrowes of one makinge: but lyke a field of corne all overgrowne with wiedes: beinge so troubled in our myndes, how to make choyce of our enemies to fight with, many of them beinge our fosterers, gossips and Allies, so that

I had allmoste forgotten, the county of Ormonde which aboue all other places in Irelande, moste representeth the shew of a comon wealth, for therein; are many faier townes, the Inhabitantes whereof, are contynually exercysed, in makinge of Caddowes, blancketes, mantles of all sotes, rugges freises, and any other comoditie that the country doth yield, by reasonne whereof, the country men haue mony for theire comodities, youth trayned vpp to learne to live, when they come to ryper yeares; and for that both there; in the citty of Waterforde and other good townes, the weomen are the ouerseers and chiefest doers in these exercyses, the men traffick for England, ffraunce, Spaigne & flanders, and to other places where the comodities, are moste vendible, havinge many faiers in that country besides where much is vttered, And for that they are contynuall dealers, with merchantes and others of England, whereby groweth acquayntance.

A nomeber of theire children, are brought vp in diuers, citties and townes there, who scorneth not to get theire livinges, and so it is in many other places of the west besydes, as Limberick, Corck, Killmalock, Yoghall and others which follow the same order, that those of the townes of Ormonde dothe, but not so generall.


Now happely it may be said, why should not all other countries besydes, of that kingdome, be brought to the lyke stay that those westerne places are, to that I awnswere that as it shoulde seme, the Erles of Ormonde discending of English bloud, and noble from the first, brought ouer in theire comepanies many gentlemen, and others of meaner sorte, as merchantes, handycraftes men, and others: who not cominge ouer for a monethe; but for euer, first strengthened themselues by fortfyinge of many townes, which as I haue said before, are good stoare in that country, which was not onely a defence for theire personnes, if the Irish whom they cam to subdue (had bene able to kepe the field, but a succor for theire people and goodes., who might apply theire trades and craftes, withowt any impeachment of the enemy, which was an especial ocasion to abandon idlenes, the chiefest maistris, that attends vpon the meere Irish.


Ffor they for the moste parte, are all gentillmen and beggers: for they will say we may not worke, for that we are men of name and landes, In deede, many of them, haue verry greate lyvinges, for in most places emongst them they devyde their landes by gauell kynde; so that if a man haue twelve sonnes, and

but one plough land euery chylde muste haue a share; so that in myne owne knowledge there be many of the chiefest bloudd of the Irish: have now scarce a good garden plot for theire shares, yet will not settle themselues to any honest trade.


There is a statute that the Irish lordes and gentillmen that houlde theire landes in this kynde, might appeale to the lord deputy and councell, and haue it graunted, vnder the broade seale, houldinge theire landes from her maiestie, as the manner of England is, from the father to the eldest sonne, and to his heire etc., which no doubt was enacted to a verry good purpose, that the rest of the bretheren or children, might apply themselues to live as in other good comon wealthes, but that as it falleth owt, did more hurt then good, except order had bene taken, that the terrytory lordes, shoulde haue bene forcid, to haue erected some stronge market townes in each of theire countries, accordinge to theire scoapes of landes, to haue trayned vpp theire youth as formerly is spoken of. In Ormond for now havinge neither landes, nor good educacion, they must needes follow theire oulde occupacions of filtchinge & stealinge: and from ii criminall factes into rebellion, to the which poynt it is now come to., there is neuer a one of these terrytory lordes. But if I were able to be harde, but should put in two principall pledges, aswell for the performance of her maiesties peace, quiet of all the well meaninge subiect, as the performinge and accomplishinge, of all the said market townes, for the purposes aforesaid, all which, if any of them did not performe, accordinge as it shoulde be laid downe, by the higher powers, I woulde hange vp one of his pledges, and take

Well now I caste at Monnsieur Tyroane, and then an ende; It is not vnknowne vnto vs all, that be here, how graciously and bountifully the noble Queene Elizabeth, hath delt with that Archtraitor, first raysinge him vp, from the dunghill, to the type and name of an Erle, the countenancinge him with horse and fote in pay, notwithstandinge he had livinge to much before, No honour was to much to bestowe, vppon this shameles companion. (who when ensample of most duty and thanckfullnes, should haue bene, expected, for her maiesties greate graces bestowed vppon him, he lyke an hippocriticall backslyder, havinge filled his cofers, with her maiesties coyne, stoared him self with furnyture, aswell forth of her maiesties office of ordynance, as from such creakers as served vnder him and Tirlagh Lenogh, in theire civill contencions, which kynde of freebootinge Capten with theire comepanies tollerated to reare and take vp Irish soldiers was the chiefest cause of martiall dyscyplyne emongst them, and then the castinge away of the Spannyardes vppon the coastes of Odonell country and

Well to be shorte those Northerne miscreantes, within these fewe yeares, knew not what the due order of fighting was and now it is a professed arte emongst the cowheardes of Vlster, God send some Good man to vnarme these roages (and put them to cow kepinge againe, for any other worke that is good they canne doe none., hemb them in with stronge townes at Collrane, the dirry, Duneluce, Clonarne, Olderfleete, and other necessary places, that the traffick that the scot hath with them may to turned to our profittes, doe the same at balleyshannon, and other necessarie places in Odonnelles country, and when the intercourse of strangers is taken from them, front them with stronge garrysonnes ffrom dundalk to the edge of Orowrkes country, and cut of the intercourse that theire kinsmen the merchantes (black and grey) that dwelleth emongst ourselues haue with them, for they are the master Badgers that help them at a pinch, with wyne, aquavitie, salt weapones, mvnicion, powder, apparrell, and other necessaries (and so doth the scot to, all which beinge but a small tyme

And yet thanckes be to god, allthough our cosens of the English Pale, haue bene scovrged in respect of theire extraordynary combynacion, yet haue they stood somewhat piller lyke, in these tymes of trouble, And so I end at this tyme, besechinge the allmighty to restoare, this forgrowne, estate to a perfect comonwealth, when his goodnes shall see tyme.


**Peregryn**
Now brother, how lyke you this oulde fellow of the English Pale.


**Silvyn**
I promis you I lyke him well for his playne dealinge; for he hath shewed many good reasons, that hath bene the overthrowe of that country, and some meanes presently how it may be remedied if matters were put in execucion: which nowe cannot easely be effected, withowt greate chardges of men victualles and mony. And sufficient personnes to mannadge the services with uprightnes, aswell forseinge that euery man haue his due., accordinge to equitie and justice: as on the contrary receavinge the same in that measure, faiele not to acomplish any thinge, that is beseeminge; vpon payne of extreame pvnishment, by the law to be

**Peregryn**
Even savinge a litle, towchinge the soldier revolted to the enemy and so an ende.


**Silvyn**
I pray you say on; for I longe to here what they canne say for themselues.


**Peregryn**
It is was my chaunce to be at an ordinary in Phillipstowne, where some of the owt start Oconnors and others, that had served longe tyme in her maiesties Garrysonne bandes (beinge then protected (came in for some refreashing for theire mony, at which tyme there chaunced to be two strangers & myself: yet they were well acquaynted with them., and emongst other talk the elder of the two, demaunded of them why they had forsaken theire alledgiances to her maiesty,


With that; one emongst the rest made awnswer; in the excurse of himself and companions, & said, that theire officers misvsed them, theire Captens stole theire pay, and if they chaunced to get a ticket in a yeare or two, it was a greate favour, as they thought, but beinge so obteigned they were driven to sell them to some clarke or merchant for half stake, and how those two kynde of petty foggers, shift for the other moitye, I referre to such, that hath better skill therein then I haue, but we all that haue served in bandes are assured the Quenes maiesty payeth the whole: Also we were kept shorte for our victuallinge mony, so that lyinge

in Townes, and not victualled by the stoare; when we had no mony, we coulde neither get cloathes to vppon credit to kepe our bodyes from weather, nor scarce victualles to houlde lyfe and soulde togither, so that we were compelled, by the negligence of such, that shoulde haue supplyed our wantes with the premisses, to rely vnto the rebelles, for vnder theire protection, we are lycensed to live as Libertynes without conptrolment.


Then falles he in hand with a younglinge, that had bene a merchantes mans servaunt, what ocasion he had to follow that course of lyfe; to whom he made awnswere, that he thought it a better gaine to be clarke to CC men, and to haue two shillinges a meale, and three shillinges for wrytinge of a letter, then to follow tadey maley his horse heeles.

Then the younger of the two, strangers fell in hande with a principall vyper emongst them, that had served longe in her maiesties pay in some reputacion, and demaunded of him why of all men: he would forsake her maiestie having bene so well delt with him.


Tush, quoth he; when the Capten hath a shorte band, and hath poasted away his Englishmen, he must needes of necessitie make vp his nomeber, what shift soeuer he makes, and then he sendes forth his scowtes, to harken where any of our sorte are, to be enterteigned who at length cvninge in that faculty, understandes of some xx or thirty of our sorte, whose behaviour hath bene such, that they may not come in withowt a protection; for the present, and after theire pardonnes (which matter is perfourmed with all expedicion, neither serchinge after any of bringing vp, either of our parentes or

And truly for ould acquayntance sake I will be playne with you. It is your owne selues, that hath brought vs vpp to this passe, that feelinge now by your meanes, we haue gotten knowledge to fight, furnyture and weapons to defend ourselues, and offende our gaynsayers: having a meete comepany to accumulate, and gather the riches of the country withowt resistaunce, we haue no reasonne to the contrary, but to take our tyme: and to be a people of ourselues Irish, and not to be commaunded by the English, for we haue borne theire yoake to longe., And one woulde will not prea vppon his lyke; Nor we hurete one another in generall, and now our faction is growne greate, wee loke to be masters of our land in Aphaley or euer it be longe. And if it fall not owt to our expectacion, there be a nvmeber of vs, that canne make frendes to come in againe, And the service well accepted at his handes that will present vs, For I knowe a nomeber my self that hath bene at the actinge of greate matters and yet huddld vp: and receaued in againe to supply voyde roomes. So that you may see: how Englishmen may be blynded. And those companies that be in the Queenes maiesties pay now, what are they I pray you, but moste Irishmen (except such as lately came forthe of Englande piccardy, for we are not Ignorant that by the statute there shoulde but six Ireland men in a band of a hundreth, and that of English race to, And now it is a greate matter if

a band haue studd, one yeare in pay and especially employed in service, if the Capten haue twelue Englishmen in his Cth, And be you assured of this that we can comaunde, a nomeber of our countrey men that are in pay, to come to vs at our pleasure, but we let them stay there, vntill we see tyme, which we doe in pollycy to worke your greater woe, for it must be them nvsled vp in your bosomes, that must devoure you. I could say more but I may not for certaine causes and with that worde they all departed the house.


**Silvyn**
Now I ensuer you brother, there is some groase kynde of dealinge in that land, in whom soeuerr the fault is, to suffer her maiesties ffourceis, to be chosen owt of so wicked a people (whose country beinge the verry picture of Idlenes it self (except in few places) there canne be neither an ende of warrs: nor meanes to reduce that state to civilitie, as longe as they are suffered to remayne armed. But what saith the muster master to it for he is a man of greate experience.


**Peregryn**
I had neuer any conference with him my self nor with any of his officers, but I haue sene some that hath had speeches, with some of his new fraternitie of commissaries towchinge the allowinge of so many Irishmen: theire awnswere was that they did nothinge but by warrant which was bothe sufficient for their master and themselues, for you must thinck that they haue a care of themselues 


---

p.137


{folio 352r}

But yet one pretty trick I hard of, That when some pauper gentillman is willinge and desyrous to be a capten and maketh greate frendes to attayne therevnto, and his advocates beinge demaunded, by such as are in aucthoritie, how he canne reare his company, of Cth or Ltie men, as the partie is in favour, to haue either more or less: tush say they that is the least care of a thowsand: he cannot want men., then beinge once graunted a chardge owt goeth a scowt as formerly I tould you and he bringth in a scvm of sconderelles, who must be furnished owt of her maiesties stoare. forthwith but for any service many of them will doe (except a litle for manner sake to bringe themselues in theire Captens lykinge theire meaninge be least. And thus is the good Quene Elizabeth, bereaued of her threasure, victualles, apparrell and mvnicion, with allmost the subuersion of that kingdome, by these vnnecessaye dealinges.


**Silvyn**
As I haue said before: I am right hartely sorry, that the Good Quene shoulde be delt with in this manner, And grieued I am to here, that which I haue harde, I pray god shall *(sic)* amended for I perceaue these fellowes in rebellion (nor many of these miscreantes in pay neither, wilbe driven to throwe away their weapons, for the sight of our whips, as the Scithians made theire bondsmen doe, at their cominge forthe of Asia, for they beinge longe abroade in the warrs, (moste of theire wyues thinking they had bene slaigne or dead, marryed themselues

Away some ranne; the rest submitted themselues to theire masters and glad to take the yoake of bondage: vppon them againe. How say you brother, will your Irish vassalles, be brought to trace this gallyard.


**Peregryn**
No I warrant you., for these fellow will not be scared with weaponnes, much lesse with whipps, and as for their peces, murrions, and swordes, they farr passe our mens for the moste parte, bothe in goodnes and well kepinge, I pray God loke vppon our deere bretheren there if it be his pleasure, And suffer them not to fall into theire handes, as our predeccessors did in ffraunce, in Henry the VIth tyme, after that diuers provinces there, had remayned many yeares in our handes, some by inheritance, and others got with the sworde, with the losse of many a mans lyfe, and yet all gon ffrom vs in a moment, And in the same manner went Callice too. In Quene Maries tymes; after it remaygned Ccxxtie yeares in our possession, being a yeare agettinge, by the renowned Kinge Edward the thirde, and lost againe in eight daies, I pray God those may serve for ensamples, towchinge the better keepinge of Irelande, beinge the parte (allthough chardgeable) that doth serve for a back armour to England.

It is verry certaine, that if that back parte of the Armour should miscarry and be cut of from England (as God forbid it should) it would make the ould

**Peregryn**
Well Brother I haue deteigned you a greate whyle, with this my Ireland newes. And now will ende with this one ensample.


A chief piller of myne sometymes, havinge had good experience, aswell by travaiele as otherwyse to give a sownde Judgement, concerninge matters of estate, havinge one other in his comepany besydes my self., fortvned emongst other matters (then fittinge for the tyme, to discourse of certaine services effected in the Ile of Creete alias Candie. I served sometymes saieth he: vnder Counte Peter, and Counte Sebastian Generalles, at suerall tymes of the Venecians Armyes, both by sea and lande, for the space of six yeares, against the enemies of that estate, beinge chiefly the Turke, but emongst all theire warrs, they were moste troubled with the Cretans (a province belonginge to the said Venecians; for they a greate tyme togither, had waged the country people there, (as we vse in Ireland now) aswell to warre against forreigne Enemies, as otherwyse against some of that nacion which did rebell. the chieftains of which comotion, were certaine Bishops of beinge nobly borne of the Greeke and Latyne churches, who many tymes bickeringe with the venecians deputies there, sometymes to theire gayne, sometymes to theire losse, At length not prevaylinge to theire expectacion, drew in the turkes, who burned one of theire chiefest citties called Rethimo, but made no longe stay there, after the doinge thereof. For which fact, emongst others by them comitted, they loked for no mercy, if they were subdued by the deputy there: And therefore as a people disparringe, gaue out by way of proclamacion, liberty to all cretans, that would take parte
