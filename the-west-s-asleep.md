### The West's Asleep: Author: Thomas Osborne Davis




---

p.349


The Brink of the White Rocks1. When all beside a vigil keep,
  
The West's asleep, the West's asleep—
  
Alas! and well may Erin weep,
  
When Connaught lies in slumber deep.
  
There lake and plain smile fair and free,
  
'Mid rocks—their guardian chivalry—
  
Sing oh! let man learn liberty
  
From crashing wind and lashing sea.
2. That chainless wave and lovely land
  
Freedom and Nationhood demand—
  
Be sure, the great God never planned,
  
For slumbering slaves, a home so grand.
  
And, long, a brave and haughty race
  
Honoured and sentinelled the place—
  
Sing oh! not even their sons' disgrace
  
Can quite destroy their glory's trace.

p.350

5. For often, in O'Connor's van,
  
To triumph dashed each Connaught clan—
  
And fleet as deer the Normans ran
  
Through Corlieu's Pass and Ardrahan.
  
And later times saw deeds as brave;
  
And glory guards Clanricarde's grave—
  
Sing oh! they died their land to save,
  
At Aughrim's slopes and Shannon's wave.
6. And if, when all a vigil keep,
  
The West's asleep, the West's asleep—
  
Alas! and well may Erin weep,
  
That Connaught lies in slumber deep.
  
But, hark! some voice like thunder spake:
  
*"The West's awake! the West's awake!"—*
  
"Sing oh! hurra! let England quake,
  
We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!"
