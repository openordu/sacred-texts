### A Game of Chess: Author: Patrick Augustine Sheehan

p.523


1. **A Game of Chess**  
A square of black, and a square of white,
  
And they call them, Nights and Days;
  
Black, where a star withdraws his light,
  
White, where he sheds his rays.
  
And the fray goes merrily on, without
  
Weapons of pen or sword,
  
And the mites move in, and the mites move out,
  
Pawns on the chequered board.
2. The demiurge, Michael (for God's afar),
  
Leans on his mighty hand
  
His brow, that is ruffled with many a scar
  
Of thought, and of high command.
  
His grim antagonist studies the game,
  
As when, on the desert rocks,
  
He studied the Face without sin or shame,
  
And the dew on the auburn locks.

p.524

5. There are knights to unhorse, and castles to storm,
  
And Queens to uncrown and dethrone,
  
And the piles of the dead and defeated form
  
The prizes each claims as his own.
  
But the duellists fight, without word or shout,
  
Or shadow of noise or sound,
  
And the mites move in, and the mites move out
  
For the world's a merry-go-round.
6. Aye! a merry-go-round-a jest and a song,
  
And the laughter of children at play,
  
And the hours stretch out, so sunny and long,
  
And Life is a summer day
  
But that now and again a drifted cloud,
  
Like the pass of a wizard's hand,
  
Darkens the sunshine, dapples the crowd,
  
And makes night over all the land.
7. Once and again o'er the murmurous mites,
  
As a wave o'er a slanting deck,
  
A dark hand sweeps, as to claim its rights,
  
And a mocking voice cries, ‘Check!’
  
And then there's a pause, and a little rout,
  
And a cry for a greater claim;
  
And the mites move in, and the mites move out
  
For Life is a Maypole game.
8. Alas! and how will it end? I trow
  
'Tis a weary game at the best,
  
And the odds lean on to the left somehow,
  
And the Angel's brow's depressed.
  
And the players would fling it up long ago,
  
But for the prize at stake,
  
And Satan will never his chances forego,
  
Nor Michael his post forsake.
9. But the pitiful thing is the victims' greed,
  
For their bubbles, and beads of glass.
  
They are deaf to the fight, nor ever heed
  
The hands that over them pass:
  
The hand of white that trembles with doubt,
  
'The black that grasps its chance,
  
And the mites move in, and the mites move out,
  
And Life is a Morris-dance.

P. A. SHEEHAN
