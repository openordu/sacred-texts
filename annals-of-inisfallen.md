#### Sources


**Manuscript source**2. Oxford, Bodleian L, Rawlinson B 503; vellum; s. xi ex (AD 1092); origin Emly. and later; 57 folios; origin Emly and other Munster houses. From the beginning to 1092.5, the MS is the work of a single hand, perhaps that of Diarmait Ó Flainn Chua, bishop and lector of Emly and abbot (r. 1092-1114), or Mael Ísu Ó hArrachtáin, abbot of
17 Emly (died 1092). The MS was continued to the early fourteenth century by some 18 scribes (only six of whom made large contributions). Mac Niocaill, however, suggests that while the earliest stratum may be associated with Emly, the annals may have been continued at Tomgraney, transcribed at Killaloe after the mid-eleventh century, and continued at Lismore from about the year 1119. The MS passed to a West-Munster monastery, most likely Inisfallen, in 1130x1159. There are lacunae 1130-59, 1214-6, 1285-95. The fact that much of the later part of these annals is in phonetic spellings lends them an additional linguistic interest. The MS came into the possession of Sir James Ware (died 1666) some time before the end of the first quarter of the seventeenth century and is described in the catalogue of his books as 'Annales coenobii Innisfallensis in agro Kerriano.' A translation of portion of these annals (1173 [= 1174] to 1281) by Dubhaltach Mac Fir Bhisigh, made for Ware, occurs in London, BL, Additional 4799. Ware has added to this translation the heading: 'Ex Annalibus coenobii Inisfathlensibus apud Kerrienses'. For more details, see Oxford Cat i 201–7.

Domnall son of Mac Carthaig, high-king of Mumu, died in Corr Tige Meic Urmainn this year on the Kalends of December as regards the day of the solar month, and on Friday as regards the day of the week. It was he, of all the contemporary kings of Ireland, who was most feared by the foreigners and by the Gaedil. During the twenty years he held the kingship, he never submitted to a foreigner; and though an army of foreigners and Gaedil often came against him, he gave them at times no more than was due, while at other times he gave them nothing. And it was he who slew the speckled kerne led by Geoffrey de Cogan, the most hated kerne that ever was in Ireland, and he flayed this Geoffrey. And it was he who inflicted the rout of Inis Eóganáin, and also that of Cell Mo-Chomóc, and the rout of Bern Meic Ímuir, and who successfully attacked the castles of Les Mór, Dún Cuireda, In Cora, and Mag Ua Mairgili, and the castles of all Uí Meic Caille. {By him nine justiciars were slain and twenty-one battles fought in Mumu}, and many other exploits performed.

But Domnall Mac Carthaig, king of Desmumu and counsellor of Ireland, came and sent a messenger and letters to them, pointing-out that they were [only] wasting Ireland and their [own] patrimony, and they all undertook to follow his advice. And it was then the king came northwards over the Sinann to Tuadmumu, where he remained three weeks almost, so that the length of his stay grieved all Desmumu. He did not return from them, however, until he brought about peace, and divided Tuadmumu between

Murchad, son of Mathgamain, son of Domnall Connachtach Ó Briain, committed treachery against Donnchad son of Tairdelbach Ó Briain, king of Tuadmumu, and that crime was a great calamity, for he was a prominent person with a large retinue, destructive [to enemies], and of goodly worth. Although de Clare and Diarmait were in Tuadmumu at that time on a hosting, the murder was not committed by either of them, for according to report, they had no great hand in it, as it was committed because of an old enmity. And the Tuadmumu immediately gave pledges and hostages to Diarmait and to de Clare, and Diarmait was made full king by the foreigners and the Gaedil.

Muirchertach, son of Tairdelbach, Mathgamain Ó Lochlainn, Aed Ó Conchobuir, and Lochlainn Riabach Ó Dedaid left Tuadmumu and went to Connachta, and from there were committing injuries against Tuadmumu. And the same William was released by de Clare on certain conditions, having given his word as a knight with other guarantees for the fulfilment thereof in the matter of his return to his former captivity. He did not, however, fulfil the conditions or keep his word as a knight, but came into Tuadmumu with a more numerous army, including many mercenary soldiers, to make war on de Clare and on Diarmait, and to obtain the kingship for Muirchertach. And they drove Diarmait eastwards over the Forgus, and he (William) took the hostages of Tuadmumu for Muirchertach, bringing them with him into Connachta, and he left Muirchertach in Cluain Rámfhata.

And he [Seoán] brought him by guile from his land to the foreigners, in order that he might be taken prisoner in their house. But the foreigners did not consent to that treachery, for they loathed it. That same Seoán was afterwards despoiled by Domnall Caech Mac Carthaig, and Domnall told the company that he carried out the raid with the connivance of Diarmait. And Diarmait brought Seoán by similar guile from the foreigners houses to the stronghold of Donnchad Mac Carthaigh to seek his consent and that of his son for the imprisonment of Seoán. And he obtained their consent, which was not surprising, for Seoán had previously abandoned Donnchad and his son for Diarmait when Diarmait was contending with them for the kingship for himself, although Seoán's relationship was nearer to them than to Diarmait. They did not consent, however, to Seoán's being taken prisoner by them or in their stronghold, and Diarmait brought him (Seoán) along to the house where he had spent the night, and there took him prisoner together with three of his followers. Diarmait set his people to attack Seoán's stronghold and to raid it again, and they did so in this wise. They carried off in equal numbers dogs and goats, hounds and sheep, beeves and pigs, cauldrons and helmets, vessels of measure and methers, ladles and breastplates, calves and kneading troughs, platters and butter containers, swords and sieves. Nevertheless, that is the most foreign-like, the most disgusting, the most outlandish and the most surprising, the most wretched, the most monstrous and the most cruel, the most exotic and most senseless thing that was done at that time or ever before in this Desmumu. Nor is it remarkable that such an unaccustomed happening should occur while such a young man was reigning, for a wise man says: Alas for a land whose king is a young man or a boy, and whose chiefs feast in the morning!

There arose at this time in the Order of the Friars Minor a dangerous sect, the members of which were called Sarabaites. They wished to deviate from the common rule of the Order, and desired (they claimed) to sweat under the rigours of a sterner life. Under the guise of religious scruple and false piety they spread the poison of their devilish ingenuity and dishonestly placed themselves, their sect, and their erroneous doctrine under the immediate protection of the Holy See and of certain members of the [Papal] Curia who supported them. On this account the Community of the Order appealed, not unadvisedly, from the aforesaid supporters and the unjust auditors (who had been appointed from among them) to the Pope and the said Council, requesting nonetheless that in the meantime the pernicious doctrine of the others, that enunciated by Friar Peter John, be wholly checked lest from the deadly draught the Lord's flock contract the disease of the erroneous leprosy.

The Scots invaded Ireland at the beginning of summer and straightway occupied much of Ulster, destroyed the town of Dún Delcan where they killed many people, and burned other surrounding towns such as Áth Fir Diad and Lugmud. Excepting homicide, however,
deeds no less evil were done by an army drawn from different parts of Ireland to do battle with them, in the districts through which the units passed. When these came to the meeting-place at the fixed time which had been arranged, the Scots had retreated secretly beforehand through Ard Macha to Es Craibe on the [river] Banna. When it became necessary for the entire army of Ireland to pursue them to Carlingford and further [north], Lord Richard, earl of Ulster, both because he feared the ruin of his lands and because he believed any addition [to his own troops] to be superfluous, stated: ‘I have here,’ said he, ‘a force of my own of 36,000 or more, and it is large enough to expel an equal number from the country, or to kill them in it. And since they have invaded my territory, I deem it preferable to proceed against them at my own expense, and to employ my own force to that effect.’


This he did, for he pursued the Scots to Cúil Rathain on the river] Banna. The latter became alarmed on his approach and burned the whole town save only the monastery of the Friars Preachers, and moreover, they destroyed the bridge so as to deprive him of a suitable passage as he was about to cross over. For those waters could not be forded save at two points, and only when there was excessive drought, which nevertheless did not occur in the above year. The Earl, thus remained on the opposite bank without interference from the enemy, awaiting a fall in the level of the water or a shortage of food among his foes. One of these [expectations] came to pass, for it was reported that in the Scotch camp four quarters of a sheep fetched two shillings sterling. On account of this dearth, however, the people of the countryside, principally Ó Néill,

Ó Catháin, andÓ Flainn, did not fail to provide for them as best they could. When the Earl saw this, he retreated to Antrim, desiring to procure plentiful supplies for his army. When he was there, about three thousand troops or more secretly withdrew from him without permission, the captain of the latter being Walter, son Lord Walter 'Catus' de Burgo. But, praise God, these were deprived of their horses, arms, and other effects on the road by the Irish of Uí Maine!


With a view to heartening his men the Earl eventually turned back to Coinnere to oppose the Scots; and there they and their Irish supporters suddenly charged him and his forces about midday before they were armed or prepared for battle, and they wounded and took prisoner William de Burgo along with many other nobles, whom they transported to Scotland. The Earl himself and his men took flight, since none would stand by him. And those who succeeded in crossing by Tráig in Ibuir were able to relate what disasters they had suffered there.

There was committed the most wretched, the most downright, the most foreignlike, the most hateful deed ever committed in Ireland until then: Diarmait, son of Conchobar Ó Conchobuir, who had been held prisoner in irons for the previous eight years by the earl of Desmumu, i.e. by James, son of Garret, was maimed and injured (i.e. blinded and emasculated) by Maurice, son of the above James, accompanied by some of the Uí Chonchobuir. And neither the earl, nor his son Thomas, had act or part in that loathsome deed, for as compensation he (the earl) afterwards despoiled those who perpetrated it.
