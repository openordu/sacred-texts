#### Sources


**MS source for the Irish text**2. Oxford, Bodleian L, Rawlinson B 503; vellum; 11th century (AD 1092); origin Emly. and later; 57 folios; origin Emly and other Munster houses. From the beginning to 1092.5, the MS is the work of a single hand, perhaps that of Diarmait Ó Flainn Chua, bishop and lector of Emly and abbot (r. 1092-1114), or Mael Ísu Ó hArrachtáin, abbot of

17 Emly (died 1092). The MS was continued to the early fourteenth century by some 18 scribes (only six of whom made large contributions). Mac Niocaill, however, suggests that while the earliest stratum may be associated with Emly, the annals may have been continued at Tomgraney, transcribed at Killaloe after the mid-eleventh century, and continued at Lismore from about the year 1119. The MS passed to a West-Munster monastery, most likely Inisfallen, in 1130x1159. There are lacunae 1130-59, 1214-6, 1285-95. The fact that much of the later part of these annals is in phonetic spellings lends them an additional linguistic interest. The MS came into the possession of Sir James Ware (died 1666) some time before the end of the first quarter of the seventeenth century and is described in the catalogue of his books as 'Annales coenobii Innisfallensis in agro Kerriano.' A translation of portion of these annals (1173 [= 1174] to 1281) by Dubhaltach Mac Fir Bhisigh, made for Ware, occurs in London, BL, Additional 4799. Ware has added to this translation the heading: 'Ex Annalibus coenobii Inisfathlensibus apud Kerrienses'.

p.46


At this time the Fir Bolg, viz. Gann and Sengann occupied [*...*]


At this time the Tuatha Dé [Danann], viz. Delbaeth and Bres, two sons of Elatha, and the Dagda, Mac ind Óc, Lug son of Eithliu, Dian Cécht, Goibnenn the smith, Luchtaine the wright, and Crédne the craftsman, overcame the Fir Bolg.


 

The sons of Míl took Ireland. Míl, son of Bile, was their father. There were four sons of Míl, viz. Ír and Éber and Éremón and Donn, and [*...*] was the fifth. This, moreover, is recounted in the Invasion of Ireland: it was at the end of twenty-seven years after the death of [*...*] , son of Iardonail, that the sons of Míl of Spain, son of Bile son of Bríge son of Ném son of Dá Thó son of Bregant son of Brath, etc. to Adam, came from Scythia. Míl son of Bile, then sets out from Scythia into exile after slaying Reflóir, son of Némi, in contending for sovereignty, with four ships on a sea-expedition, and in each ship fifteen married couples as well as an unmarried mercenary soldier. They remained three months in Taprobane Island. Another three months at sea until they reached Pharaoh, king of Egypt, [*...*] there. They remained seven years with Pharaoh in Egypt [*...*] they practised their various arts and various actions. Scotta, Pharaoh's daughter, married Míl, son of Bile, in the eighth year

p.47


Pharaoh was drowned subsequently with his host in the Red Sea. When he [Míl] and his people find out that, they set out by sea with the same number and Scotta, Pharaoh's daughter, in addition, and they landed in Taprobane Island. They remained a month in it. They voyaged after that around Scythia to the entrance of the Caspian Sea. They anchored twenty-seven days in the Caspian Sea by reason of the singing of the mermaids until Caicher the druid, delivered them. They rowed after that past the promontary of the Rhiphaean Mountain, coming from the north, until they landed in Dacia. They remained a month there. Caicher the druid, said to them: Until we reach Ireland we shall not halt. They then rowed past Gothia and past Germania to Bregantia and they landed in Spain. They found it uninhabited on their arrival. They remained there, dwelling in it, for thirty years, and it was from it 'Míl of Spain' was named; and there the two sons of Míl, viz. Éremón and Ír were born. And they are the two youngest. The two eldest, however, are Donn and Éber. They were born in the East, viz. Donn in Scythia and Éber in Egypt. A pestilence lasting one day, came upon them in Spain and twelve of their married couples, in addition to their three kings, viz. Míl Uice, and Occe, died. Forty-eight married couples and four mercenary soldiers set out after that with the sons of Míl and Scotta, Pharaoh's daughter, over sea to Ireland. A great storm arose (against them) and parted the ship in which Donn [*...*] was [from the others]. He and the crew of his ship were drowned at the sand-dunes in the western sea, hence the name Tech Duinn. The sons of Míl divided Ireland between them after that, as the historians relate.


The death of Éber, son of Míl, in Argedros, and his grave was made there.



In this year the eruption of Brosnach of Tír Éile over the land.


Ireland was divided into five between the sons of Cermait, viz. Mac Cécht and Mac Guill and Mac Gréine [*...*] the Tuatha Dé [Danann] afterwards, and these kings perished with them.

Ireland was divided between the sons of Éremón, viz. Muimne and Luigne and Laigne. Nuadu Argatlám [*...*] a lad at that time. Every family [*...*] subsequently in Ireland is of the race of Nuadu on account of his maintenance by his kinsmen and on account of his patience.


At this time the eruption of Loch dá Chaech.


Ireland was divided after that between Cermna and Sobairche, [the division being] from Inber Colptha to Luimnech.

Ireland was divided into twenty-five parts between the sons of Úgaine Mór, son of Eochu Buadach, for it was Úgaine Mór who first held Ireland after the chieftains of the Dagda, viz. Cobthach Cael Breg in Brega and Laegaire Lorc in Liphe.


Now begins the sovereignty of the Medes after the termination of the reign of the Assyrians.


There were three kings of Ireland, who were from Munster: Eochaid Aircdech, Eterscél Mór, and Conaire Mór maccu Iair. The latter was the last king of Ireland from Munster.

They were called Persians from Persius—he was the son of Job—who gave them that name.

Fifty thousand was the number of these captives, with five thousand vessels of gold and four hundred vessels of silver. The king gave them all permission to go to Jerusalem at the end of the seventh month. Zarobabel was the name of the man who was their leader, and Jeshua, son of Josedek, was the priest, and Esdras the prophet. Nehemiah moreover, was the other leader, who built the walls of the city after reaching the south. Cyrus was in the sovereignty for thirty years, and he fell in Scythia together with three hundred thousand. By this Cyrus, viz. Cyrus son of Darius, Babylon was built.

The kingship was divided after him into twenty-four parts, and it was carved up again and divided between four persons, viz. Ptolemy son of Lagus in Egypt, Philip the brother of the king, i.e. Alexander, in Macedon, Antigonus in Asia Minor, Niccanor Seleucus in Syria and in Babylon.


Greeks were chief sovereigns for two hundred and eighty-six years. They had twelve kings, and a queen, viz. Cleopatra, and she reigned last until Julius Caesar deposed her.


Ireland was divided into five between Conchobar, Cairpre Nia Fer, Tigernach Tétbannach, Dedad son of Sen, and Ailill son of Mága.

If Christ's age be thirty-four years, [the Passion] is on the fifteenth of the Kalends [of April], the fourteenth of the Paschal. If, however, it be thirty-three and a half, the Passion is on the eighth of the Kalends of April, and the Resurrection is on the sixth of the Kalends of April,

Fínnechta Fledach, son of Dúnchad: it was he who remitted the **Bóroma** Laigen to Moling of Luachair for a poem which Moling had composed for him. For during the reign of forty kings it was paid, viz. from Tuathal Techtmar to Fínnachta. That was the recompense for the two daughters of Tuathal, whom Eochu son of Eochu, king of Laigin, wantonly killed. This, moreover, was the **Bóroma**: thrice five thousand cows, and thrice five thousand boars, and thrice five thousand mantles. Each of these also [to be paid] yearly. It was thus the tribute used to be paid. This Fínnechta reigned ten years.
