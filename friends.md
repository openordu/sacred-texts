p.71


1. Now must I these three praise—
  
Three women that have wrought
  
What joy is in my days;
  
One that no passing thought,
  
Nor those unpassing cares,
  
No, not in these fifteen
  
Many times troubled years,
  
Could ever come between
  
Heart and delighted heart;
  
And one because her hand
  
Had strength that could unbind
  
What none can understand,
  
What none can have and thrive,
  
Youth's dreamy load, till she
  
So changed me that I live
  
Labouring in ecstasy.
  
And what of her that took
  
All till my youth was gone

p.72


With scarce a pitying look?
  
How should I praise that one?
  
When day begins to break
  
I count my good and bad,
  
Being wakeful for her sake,
  
Remembering what she had,
  
What eagle look still shows,
  
While up from my heart's root
  
So great a sweetness flows
  
I shake from head to foot.
