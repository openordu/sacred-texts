### The Peal of Another Trumpet: Author: James Clarence Mangan




---

p.109


[1](javascript:footNote('E840000-042/note001.html'))1. Youths of Ireland, patriots, friends!
  
Know ye what shall be your course
  
When the storm that now impends
  
Shall come down in all its force?


---

p.110


Glance around you! You behold
  
How the horizon of the Time
  
Hourly wears a duskier hue,
  
From all else await we bold
  
Bearing, and Resolve sublime—
  
Youths of Ireland, what from you?
2. Will you bide irresolute?
  
Will you stand with folded arms,
  
Purposeless, disheartened, mute,
  
As men hopeless of escape,
  
Till the wildest, worst alarms
  
Of your souls take giant shape?
  
Are you dastards? Are you dolts?
  
Irishmen! shall you be seen
  
With white lips and faltering mien,
  
When all on earth, when heaven above,
  
Torn by thousand thunderbolts,
  
Rocks and reels which way you move?
3. Oh, no! no! forfend it, Heaven!
  
Such debasement cannot be!
  
Pillaged of your liberty,
  
You are not as yet bereaven
  
Of that heritage of bravery
  
Which descends to you through ages,
  
And ennobles all—save slavery.
  
Yours, thank God, are manhood still,
  
And the inborn strength of soul,
  
Which nought outward can control,
  
And the headlong chariot—Will,
  
Ever-bounding, never-bending,


---

p.111


Which alike with Sword or Song,
  
As befits the season, wages
  
Unrelenting war with Wrong—
  
Unrelenting and unending.
4. Gentler gifts are yours, no less,
  
Tolerance of the faults of others,
  
Love of mankind as your brothers,
  
Generous Pity, Tenderness,
  
Soul-felt sympathy with grief:
  
The warm heart, the winged hand,
  
Whereso suffering craves relief.
  
Through all regions hath your fame
  
For such virtues long gone forth.
  
The swart slave of Kaffirland,
  
The frozen denizen of the North,
  
The dusk Indian Mingo chief
  
In his lone savannahs green,
  
The wild, wandering Beddaween
  
Mid his wastes of sand and flame;
  
All have heard how, unsubdued
  
By long centuries of sorrow,
  
You still cherish in your bosoms
  
The deep Love no wrongs can slay,
  
And the Hopes which, crushed to-day,
  
Rear their crests afresh, renewed,
  
In immortal youth, to-morrow,
  
Like the Spring's rejoicing blossoms.
5. And 'tis well you thus can blend
  
Softest moods of mind with sternest—
  
Well you thus can temper earnest
  
Might with more than Feminine meekness,


---

p.112


Thus can soar and thus descend;
  
For even now the wail of Want,
  
The despairing cry of Weakness,
  
Rings throughout a stricken land,
  
And blood-blackening Plague and gaunt
  
Famine roam it hand-in-hand!
  
To you, now, the millions turn
  
With glazed eyes and lips that burn—
  
To you lies their last appeal,
  
To your hearts—your feelings—reason!
  
Oh, stretch forth your hands in season!
  
Soothe and solace—help and heal!
  
Rich in blessings, bright with beauty,
  
Shine their names throughout all æons,
  
Theirs who nobly consecrate
  
To self-sacrificing Duty
  
Their best years—the new St. Leons,
  
Who thus conquer Time and Fate![2](javascript:footNote('E840000-042/note002.html'))
6. But for more, far more, than this,
  
Youths of Ireland, stand prepared!
  
Revolution's red abyss
  
Burns beneath us, all but bared—
  
And on high the fire-charged Cloud
  
Blackens in the firmament,
  
And afar we list the loud
  
Sea-voice of the unknown Event.
  
Youths of Ireland, stand prepared!
  
For all woes the Meek have dree'd,
  
For all risks the Brave have dared,


---

p.113


As for suffering, so for Deed,
  
Stand prepared!
  
For the Pestilence that striketh
  
Where it listeth, whom it liketh,
  
For the Blight whose deadly might
  
Desolateth day and night—
  
For a Sword that never spared
  
Stand prepared!
  
Though that gory Sword be bared
  
Be not scared!
  
Do not blench and dare not falter!
  
For the axe and for the halter
  
Stand prepared!
  
And give God the glory
  
If, whene'er the Wreath of Story
  
Swathe your names, the men whose hands
  
Brightly twine it,
  
May enshrine it
  
In one temple with your lands!
